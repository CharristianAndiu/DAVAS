      "abstract": "The ca. 1525 Ma igneous Mucajaí anorthosite–monzonite–granite (AMG) complex in northern Brazil is a rare manifestation of Mesoproterozoic intraplate magmatism in the northern Amazonian Craton. The complex comprises a two-phase rapakivi granite batholith with subordinate quartz–fayalite monzonites and syenites and the closely associated Repartimento anorthosite. Zircon U–Pb (ID–TIMS) geochronology reveals that the anorthosite (1526 ± 2 Ma), monzonite (1526 ± 2 Ma), and the main-phase biotite–hornblende granite (1527 ± 2 Ma) of the complex intruded the Paleoproterozoic (~ 1.94 Ga) country rocks simultaneously at ~ 1526 Ma and that the more evolved biotite granite is marginally younger at 1519 ± 2 Ma. Intraplate magmatism in the Mucajaí region was relatively short-lived and lasted 12 million years (1529–1517 Ma) at maximum. The Nd (whole-rock, ID–TIMS; ε from − 1.9 to − 2.8), Hf (zircon, LAM-ICP-MS; ε from − 2.0 to − 3.1), and O (zircon, SIMS; δO from 6.1 to 7.0‰) isotopic compositions of the studied rocks are fairly uniform but still reveal a small degree of isotopic heterogeneity in the Paleoproterozoic crust enclosing the complex. The small isotopic differences observed in the two types of rapakivi granites (biotite–hornblende granite and biotite granite) may result either from an isotopically heterogeneous lower crustal source or, more likely, from contamination of the granitic magma derived from a lower crustal source during prolonged residence at upper crustal levels.► Petrogenesis of the 1525 Ma Mucajaí complex in Brazil was studied. ► U–Pb, Sm–Nd, Lu–Hf, and O isotopic and geochemical methods were utilized. ► Rapakivi granite and anorthositic magmatism lasted at most 12 million years. ► Late magmatic shift in isotope compositions of coeval granites was observed.",

      "abstract": "Pristine samples from the lunar highlands potentially offer important information bearing on the nature of early crustal development on all the terrestrial planets. One apparently unique sample of this group of lunar crustal rocks, the feldspathic lherzolite 67667, was studied utilizing the Sm-Nd radiometric system in an attempt to define its age and the implications of that age for the evolution of the lunar highlands. Data for 67667 precisely define an isochron corresponding to an age of 4.18±0.07 AE. The observed lack of disturbance of the Sm-Nd system of this sample may suggest that this time marks its crystallization at shallow depth in the lunar crust. However, the possibility that this age, as well as those of other highland rocks, indicate the time of their impact-induced excavation from regions deep enough in the lunar crust to allow subsolidus isotopic equilibrium to be produced or maintained between their constituent minerals is also considered. Taken together, bulk rock Sm-Nd data for four “high-Mg” rocks, including 67667, indicate that the chemical characteristics of all their source materials were established 4.33±0.08 AE ago and were intimately associated with the parent materials of KREEP. This finding provides more support for the concept of a large-scale differentiation episode early in lunar history. The possible roles of the crystallization of a global magma ocean, endogenous igneous activity, and of planetesimal impact, in producing the observed geochemical and chronological aspects of lunar highland rocks are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The Karacadağ (Kulu-Konya) area is one of the main volcanic provinces in Central Anatolia. The Karacadağ volcanites are composed of large volumes of andesitic-dacitic lavas associated with pyroclastics and small volumes of alkali basalt, trachybasalt and trachyandesite lavas. Two groups of volcanic rocks can be distinguished: (1) calcalkaline rocks including andesites and dacites, and (2) alkaline rocks including basalts, trachybasalts and trachyandesites. Ar/Ar ages show that the Karacadağ volcanites were erupted during Early Miocene (ca.18–19 Ma) and suggest that alkaline volcanites succeed shortly afterwards calcalkaline volcanites. Major oxides and trace elements plotted versus SiO suggest fractionation of hornblende, Fe–Ti oxide and apatite for calcalkaline volcanic rocks and olivine, clinopyroxene and Fe–Ti oxide for alkaline volcanic rocks in the magmatic evolution. The incompatible trace element patterns of the calcalkaline volcanites show enrichment of LILEs (Sr, K, Rb, Ba and Th) and negative HFSEs (Nb, Ta) anomalies suggesting an enriched lithospheric source by a subduction-related process. On the other hand, alkaline volcanites show enrichment of both LILEs and HFSEs suggesting an enriched lithospheric source by small volume melts from the asthenosphere. The rocks also have moderately fractionated REE patterns with (La/Lu) ratios of 7–24 for calcalkaline and 6–17 for alkaline volcanites. Moreover, the volcanites have relatively low Sr/Sr(t) ratios for between 0.703782 and 0.705129, and high () values between +2.25 and +4.49. Generally, the Sr–Nd isotopic compositions of the rocks range from the mantle array to bulk earth. All of these observations and findings suggest that the calcalkaline volcanites were formed in a subduction modified orogenic setting, and the alkaline volcanites in a within-plate setting.",

      "abstract": "Strontium and carbon isotopes of marine carbonates are routinely applied for chemostratigraphic cross correlations of time-equivalent sedimentary sequences and for calibration of the compositional evolution of seawater throughout Earth's history, mainly for the purpose of reconstructing ancient climatic changes. We here present results of a new isotopic tracer system – stable chromium isotopes – applied to a late Ediacaran marine carbonate sequence exposed in the Calera de Recalde syncline, Arroyo del Soldado Group, Uruguay. The aim was to compare Cr isotope signatures directly to δC, Sr/Sr and Nd/Nd fluctuations in a well defined stratigraphic profile comprising sediments that were deposited during cold–warm periods accompanied by sea-level changes in response to glaciation–deglaciation at higher latitudes. The studied section is characterized by a pronounced negative (down to − 3.3‰) δC excursion in carbonates paralleled by a decrease of Sr/Sr values. Chromium isotope signatures over this section also show a correlated decrease in δCr (δCr = [((Cr/Cr) / (Cr/Cr)) − 1] × 1000) values from ~+0.29 to − 0.17‰ which mirrors a decrease in positively fractioned seawater signatures to slightly negative values characteristic of high-temperature magmatic sources. Linear correlations between δCr and εNd(570 Ma), Sr/Sr and Cr concentrations can be explained by mixing between two major input sources of Cr, Nd and Sr into the shallow seawater: 1) a source characterized by negative δCr values of ~−0.2‰ , low Sr/Sr values of ~ 0.707, and elevated Sm/Nd values of ~ 0.13, recognized as a subaqueous hydrothermal dominated input source, and 2) a source characterized by positively fractionated δCr values of ~+0.2‰, higher Sr/Sr values of ~ 0.708, and lower Sm/Nd values of ~ 0.11, a source which is strongly affected by continentally derived input. Chromium isotopes provide a powerful tool for reconstructing the redox state of ancient seawater since positive values indicate that, at least locally, Neoproterozoic shallow ocean waters were sufficiently oxidized to fractionate chromium and/or that oxygen levels of the atmosphere were sufficient to transform Cr(III) into the more mobile hexavalent Cr(VI) formed during weathering processes on land.The fact that Sr/Sr values, despite δC fluctuations, remain low (indicative of a strong hydrothermal input into the basin at his time) implies that CO limitation was the cause of negative δC and δCr excursions in otherwise nutrient rich late Neoproterozoic basins, and that glaciation is only one more consequence of a tectonically driven, biologically mediated system. In such a scenario, glaciation acts as an amplifier of δCr signals. These signals in marine carbonates are a sensitive tracer for redox processes in the ocean and/or on land and have the potential to contribute significantly, in combination with the other commonly used isotopic tracers, to the reconstruction of climatic changes, particularly those that are associated with major glaciation periods in Earth's history.► Systematic Cr isotope record over a Late Ediacaran negative δC excursion. ► Covariations between Sr, Nd and Cr isotopes imply a two source mixing. ► Mirroring of the δC excursion by δCr reflects changes in bioproductivity. ► Cr isotopes in marine carbonates potentially monitor atmospheric fluctuations.",

      "abstract": "The Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions for the Kovdor phoscorite–carbonatite complex (PCC), Kola Peninsula, NW Russia, have been determined to characterize the mantle sources involved and to evaluate the relative contributions of a plume and subcontinental lithospheric mantle in the formation of the complex. The Kovdor PCC is a part of the Kovdor ultramafic–alkaline–carbonatite massif, and consists of six intrusions. The initial isotopic ratios of the analyzed samples, calculated at 380 Ma, display limited variations: , + 2.0 to + 4.7; Sr/Sr, 0.70319 to 0.70361 (, − 12.2 to − 6.2); Pb/Pb, 18.38 to 18.74; Pb/Pb, 15.45 to 15.50; Pb/Pb, 37.98 to 39.28. The Nd and Sr isotope data of the Kovdor PCC generally fit the patterns of the other phoscorites and carbonatites from the Kola Alkaline Province (KAP), but some data are slightly shifted from the mixing line defined as the Kola Carbonatite Line, having more radiogenic Sr/Sr ratios. However, the less radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions and negative Δ7/4 values of Pb isotopes of the analyzed samples exclude crustal contamination, but imply the involvement of a metasomatized lithospheric mantle source. Isotopic variations indicate mixing of at least three distinct mantle components: FOZO-like primitive plume component, EMI-like enriched component and DMM-like depleted component. The isotopic nature of the EMI- and DMM-like mantle component observed in the Kovdor samples is considered to be inherited from metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle. This supports the previous models invoking plume–lithosphere interaction to explain the origin of the Devonian alkaline carbonatite magmatism in the KAP.",

      "abstract": "The Dadian alkaline intrusive complex is located within the Sulu orogenic belt, and includes hornblende syenite, syenite, quartz syenite and syenite porphyry. All the rocks from the complex show high SiO, KO + NaO and LREE and low CaO, FeO, MgO and HFSE (Nb, Ta, P, Ti) concentrations. The Sr, Nd, and Hf isotopic compositions ((Sr/Sr) = 0.708505–0.70876, ε() = − 16.5 to − 17.9, ε() = − 21.5 to − 16.4) of the rocks fall within the compositional field of mafic dykes occurring nearby, suggesting that the Dadian alkaline complex was mainly derived from an enriched lithospheric mantle. The initial Pb compositions ((Pb/Pb) = 16.706–16.779, (Pb/Pb) = 15.427–15.450, (Pb/Pb) = 37.266–37.352) of the Dadian rocks are lower than those of the Yangtze lithospheric mantle, albeit similar to that reported from beneath the North China Craton, implying that the mantle source of the Dadian alkaline complex most likely belong to the North China Craton. The relatively high SiO and HREE contents and low Nb/Ta ratios as well as strongly negative Eu and Sr anomalies of some of the rocks from the Dadian complex suggest that crustal material was also involved in the formation of this complex and that the crustal component was probably derived through partial melting at low pressure. The high crystallization temperatures revealed by zircon saturation thermometry and low pressures suggested by Al-in-hornblende barometry indicate that the Dadian alkaline complex crystallized at high temperature and intruded into shallow crustal level. This intrusive complex does not show any relationship with post-orogenic process in the region, and its petrogenesis is inferred to be associated with the Paleo-Pacific subduction tectonics.► We report the Dadian alkaline complex was mainly derived from an enriched lithospheric mantle and contaminated by crustal material during magma ascend. ► Our study has important implications on the crust–mantle interaction in the Sulu orogenic belt and concluded that this intrusive complex does not show any relationship with post-orogenic process in the region, and its petrogenesis is inferred to be associated with the Paleo-Pacific subduction tectonics.",

The primitive alkaline intraplate basalts from the Payenia volcanic province (34–38 °S) in Argentina, for which Sr, Nd and double-spike Pb isotope ratios are presented, and from other north Patagonian volcanic fields may provide details of the eclogite melt–peridotite reactions taking place in the melting column of an upwelling OIB-type mantle. The isotopic composition of the uncontaminated lavas is highly restricted but the Payenia basalts fall in two distinct trace element groups termed the high and low Nb/U groups, which both have EM1-type trace element patterns but with subtle differences that cannot be explained by contamination, fractionation or simple variations in degrees of mantle melting. The difference is also clear in major elements where the low Nb/U basalts have markedly higher alkali contents but lower FeO and Ni than the high Nb/U basalts. Four melt components have been identified based on olivine fractionation corrected compositions: a low Nb/U pyroxenite melt component which is interpreted as an eclogite melt that experienced low degrees of melt–peridotite interaction, a high Nb/U pyroxenite melt component which is interpreted as an eclogite melt that experienced high degrees of melt–peridotite interaction, a low pressure peridotite melt component which contributes to most high Nb/U, Payún Matrú, Matancilla and Auca Mahuida basalts and finally, a melt component with similarities to peridotite melts contributing to many low Nb/U lavas. The high Nb/U type basalts are interpreted to have been formed from mantle with higher temperature than ambient mantle while the low Nb/U basalts may have been formed from normal temperature mantle.",

The lithophile element-depleted nature of FAB has been linked to initiation of IBM subduction in the Eocene, but Sm-Nd model ages and errorchron relationships in Site U1438 basement indicate that the depleted character of the rocks is a regional characteristic that was produced well prior to the time of subduction initiation and persists today in the source of modern IBM arc volcanic rocks with Sm/Nd\\u202f>\\u202f0.34 and ε\\u202f∼\\u202f9.0.",

      "abstract": "New U–Pb ages and Sr–Nd–Hf isotopic data on mineral phases of the Sung Valley and Jasra ultramafic-alkaline-(carbonatite) intrusions (Shillong Plateau, India) shed new light on the petrogenetic processes of volcanism in north-eastern India during the Cretaceous. Perovskites of Sung Valley dunite, ijolite and uncompahgrite yielded U–Pb ages of 109.1\\u202f±\\u202f1.6, 104.0\\u202f±\\u202f1.3 and 101.7\\u202f±\\u202f3.6\\u202fMa, respectively. A U–Pb age of 106.8\\u202f±\\u202f1.5\\u202fMa was obtained on zircons of a Sung Valley nepheline syenite. Perovskite of a Jasra clinopyroxenite yielded an age of 101.6\\u202f±\\u202f1.2\\u202fMa, different from the U–Pb age of 106.8\\u202f±\\u202f0.8\\u202fMa on zircon of Jasra syenites. The variation in Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions [initial Sr/Sr\\u202f=\\u202f0.70472 to 0.71080; ε\\u202f=\\u202f−10.85 to +0.86; ε\\u202f=\\u202f−7.43 to +1.52] matches the bulk-rock isotopic composition of the different rock units of Sung Valley and Jasra. Calcite and apatite in the carbonatites, the perovskite in a dunite, and the bulk-rock carbonatites of Sung Valley intrusion have the lowest initial Sr/Sr and ε, taken to be the best proxies of the mantle source composition, which is dominated by components derived from the lithospheric mantle. The alkaline intrusions of north-eastern India are significantly younger than the Sylhet tholeiitic magmatism. The silicate rocks of both intrusions have isotopic composition trending to that of the underlying Shillong crust, indicating the effects of fractional crystallization and low-pressure crustal contamination during the emplacement of the various intrusive magma pulses.",
