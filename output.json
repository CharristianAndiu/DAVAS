We here present results of a new isotopic tracer system \xe2\x80\x93 stable chromium isotopes \xe2\x80\x93 applied to a late Ediacaran marine carbonate sequence exposed in the Calera de Recalde syncline, Arroyo del Soldado Group, Uruguay. The aim was to compare Cr isotope signatures directly to \xce\xb4C, Sr/Sr and Nd/Nd fluctuations in a well defined stratigraphic profile comprising sediments that were deposited during cold\xe2\x80\x93warm periods accompanied by sea-level changes in response to glaciation\xe2\x80\x93deglaciation at higher latitudes. The studied section is characterized by a pronounced negative (down to \xe2\x88\x92 3.3\xe2\x80\xb0) \xce\xb4C excursion in carbonates paralleled by a decrease of Sr/Sr values. Chromium isotope signatures over this section also show a correlated decrease in \xce\xb4Cr (\xce\xb4Cr = [((Cr/Cr) / (Cr/Cr)) \xe2\x88\x92 1] \xc3\x97 1000) values from ~+0.29 to \xe2\x88\x92 0.17\xe2\x80\xb0 which mirrors a decrease in positively fractioned seawater signatures to slightly negative values characteristic of high-temperature magmatic sources. Linear correlations between \xce\xb4Cr and \xce\xb5Nd(570 Ma), Sr/Sr and Cr concentrations can be explained by mixing between two major input sources of Cr, Nd and Sr into the shallow seawater: 1) a source characterized by negative \xce\xb4Cr values of ~\xe2\x88\x920.2\xe2\x80\xb0 , low Sr/Sr values of ~ 0.707, and elevated Sm/Nd values of ~ 0.13, recognized as a subaqueous hydrothermal dominated input source, and 2) a source characterized by positively fractionated \xce\xb4Cr values of ~+0.2\xe2\x80\xb0, higher Sr/Sr values of ~ 0.708, and lower Sm/Nd values of ~ 0.11, a source which is strongly affected by continentally derived input. Chromium isotopes provide a powerful tool for reconstructing the redox state of ancient seawater since positive values indicate that, at least locally, Neoproterozoic shallow ocean waters were sufficiently oxidized to fractionate chromium and/or that oxygen levels of the atmosphere were sufficient to transform Cr(III) into the more mobile hexavalent Cr(VI) formed during weathering processes on land.The fact that Sr/Sr values, despite \xce\xb4C fluctuations, remain low (indicative of a strong hydrothermal input into the basin at his time) implies that CO limitation was the cause of negative \xce\xb4C and \xce\xb4Cr excursions in otherwise nutrient rich late Neoproterozoic basins, and that glaciation is only one more consequence of a tectonically driven, biologically mediated system. In such a scenario, glaciation acts as an amplifier of \xce\xb4Cr signals. These signals in marine carbonates are a sensitive tracer for redox processes in the ocean and/or on land and have the potential to contribute significantly, in combination with the other commonly used isotopic tracers, to the reconstruction of climatic changes, particularly those that are associated with major glaciation periods in Earth\'s history.\xe2\x96\xba Systematic Cr isotope record over a Late Ediacaran negative \xce\xb4C excursion. \xe2\x96\xba Covariations between Sr, Nd and Cr isotopes imply a two source mixing. \xe2\x96\xba Mirroring of the \xce\xb4C excursion by \xce\xb4Cr reflects changes in bioproductivity. \xe2\x96\xba Cr isotopes in marine carbonates potentially monitor atmospheric fluctuations.",\n        "Earth and Planetary Science Letters",\n        "10.1016/J.EPSL.2011.10.009",\n        "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X11005966",\n        "2011-12-01"\n    ],\n    [\n        "elsevier_219a105beec6e4543076e6e08395200ece078488",\n        "Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd\xe2\x80\x93Pb isotopic compositions of the Kovdor phoscorite\xe2\x80\x93carbonatite complex, Kola Peninsula, NW Russia",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\"], \\"name\\": [\\"Mi Jung Lee\\", \\"Jong Ik Lee\\", \\"Soon Do Hur\\", \\"Yeadong Kim\\", \\"Jacques Moutte\\", \\"Elena Balaganskaya\\"]}",\n        "The Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions for the Kovdor phoscorite\xe2\x80\x93carbonatite complex (PCC), Kola Peninsula, NW Russia, have been determined to characterize the mantle sources involved and to evaluate the relative contributions of a plume and subcontinental lithospheric mantle in the formation of the complex.

Lead isotopic ratios are depleted, with Pb/Pb\xe2\x80\xaf=\xe2\x80\xaf17.8\xe2\x80\x9318.8 accompanying relatively high Pb/Pb, indicating an Indian-MORB source unlike that of West Philippine Basin plume basalts.

The principal objectives of this study are to obtain precise radiometric ages, initial Sr isotopic compositions, and to search for the erstwhile presence of the short-lived nuclei Sm and Al via their daughter products. The isotopic compositions of Sm, U, Ca, and Ti were also measured. This allows a detailed appraisal to be made of the relations between, and the geneology of, these two angrites.LEW proves to be severely contaminated with modern terrestrial Pb, which is shown to result from terrestrial weathering. Nevertheless, concordant Pb-Pb model ages of pyroxene separates were obtained (2\xcf\x83): 4.55784 \xc2\xb1 52 Ga for LEW and 4.55780 \xc2\xb1 42 Ga for ADOR. Uranium isotopic compositions are normal within error. The inferred initial Pb isotopic composition is within error of primordial Pb, as defined by Ca\xc3\xb1on Diablo troilite. Because of the extreme ratios of both angrites, this places an upper limit of ~2 Ma on the time between volatile element-loss of the angrite parent body or its precursor planetesimals and the final crystallization of the angrites as differentiates. Initial ratios were found to be indistinguishable in LEW, ADOR, and the cumulate eucrite Moore County. The derived initial for all three meteorites is 0.698970 \xc2\xb1 15 (2\xcf\x83). A Sm-Nd isochron for LEW was obtained, yielding an age of 4.553 \xc2\xb1 34 Ga with an initial of 0.506682 \xc2\xb1 49 (2\xcf\x83). SmNd isotope systematics were also measured. Anomalies on Nd arising from extinct Sm were clearly resolved, resulting in an initial of 0.0071 \xc2\xb1 17 with = \xe2\x88\x922.57 \xc2\xb1 0.62 at the time of isotopic closure. Both of these Sm-Nd methods imply derivation of LEW from a reservoir with chondritic ratio; they are also quite consistent with the previously reported systematics for ADOR. Overall, the age and isotopic similarities between LEW and ADOR are striking; it suggests almost simultaneous production on the same asteroid, even though recent experimental studies imply that the two are not comagmatic.Calcium and titanium do not exhibit enrichments in the -rich isotopes, in contrast to CAIs, making it unlikely that the angrite parent body is inherently rich in early condensates from the solar nebula. No evidence was found for live Al in LEW. When combined with the Pb-Pb age and initial data, this firmly excludes Al being an important heat source in the early solar system; heat supplied for, for example, (1) the differentiation of the angrite and eucrite parent bodies, and (2) metamorphism of the chondrite parent bodies must come from some other source. The debate over live vs. extinct Al in the earliest solar system remains unresolved by this new data from LEW, however.Both the angrite and eucrite parent bodies have extremely low and high ratios compared to the solar nebula. Therefore, the common initial of 0.698970 can be firmly associated with the U-Pb angrite age above, and the formation of both bodies. This enables an absolute chronology of the early solar system to be established. Based upon differences, the oldest CAIs are a minimum of 11 \xc2\xb1 4 Ma older than the angrites, i.e., 4.569 \xc2\xb1 5 Ga.

The metabasite\xe2\x80\x93plagiogneiss\xe2\x80\x93migmatite association in the Oldest Basement Unit (OBU) of TCM represents a Neoproterozoic oceanic lithosphere intruded by gabbro\xe2\x80\x93diorite\xe2\x80\x93quartz diorite plutons of the Gray Granite Basement Complex (GGBC) that constitute the plutonic foundation of an island arc terrane. The Tectonic M\xc3\xa9lange Zone (TMZ) within the Middle-Late Carboniferous Microcline Granite Basement Complex includes thrust sheets composed of various lithologies derived from this arc-ophiolite assemblage. The serpentinized peridotites in the OBU and the TMZ have geochemical features and primary spinel composition (0.35) typical of mid-ocean ridge (MOR)-type, cpx-bearing spinel harzburgites. The metabasic rocks from these two tectonic units are characterized by low-K, moderate-to high-Ti, olivine-hypersthene-normative, tholeiitic basalts representing N-MORB to transitional to E-MORB series. The analyzed peridotites and volcanic rocks display a typical melt-residua genetic relationship of MOR-type oceanic lithosphere.

Mafic to intermediate plutonic rocks of GGBC show tholeiitic to calc-alkaline evolutionary trends with LILE and LREE enrichment patterns, Y and HREE depletion, and moderately negative anomalies of Ta, Nb, and Ti, characteristic of suprasubduction zone originated magmas. U\xe2\x80\x93Pb zircon dates, Rb\xe2\x80\x93Sr whole-rock isochron, and Sm\xe2\x80\x93Nd mineral isochron ages of these plutonic rocks range between \xe2\x88\xbc 750 Ma and 540 Ma, constraining the timing of island arc construction as the Neoproterozoic\xe2\x80\x93Early Cambrian. The Nd and Sr isotopic ratios and the model and emplacement ages of massive quartz diorites in GGBC suggest that pre-Pan African continental crust was involved in the evolution of the island arc terrane. This in turn indicates that the ANS may not be made entirely of juvenile continental crust of Neoproterozoic age. Following its separation from ANS in the Early Paleozoic, TCM underwent a period of extensive crustal growth during 330\xe2\x80\x93280 Ma through the emplacement of microcline granite plutons as part of a magmatic arc system above a Paleo-Tethyan subduction zone dipping beneath the southern margin of Eurasia.

In this study we report the occurrence of about twenty new small outcrops of extrusive carbonatites on Brava Island (64 km), the south-westernmost island of the archipelago. These new occurrences are studied from geological, petrographic, mineral chemistry and whole rock (elemental and isotopic) geochemical points of view, allowing for a discussion of their petrogenesis and emphasising their geological and geochemical peculiarities in the context of the Cape Verde carbonatites.Most of the extrusive carbonatitic formations correspond to pyroclastic rocks, comprising magmatic and/or phreatomagmatic ash and lapilli fall deposits and one probable pyroclastic flow. Lava flows occur at one locality. The predominance of pyroclastic facies demonstrates the significant explosivity of these magmas characterised by very low viscosity. Independent of the modes of emplacement, all samples are calciocarbonatites and exhibit a remarkable compositional uniformity, considering that they represent several different eruptions and present a wide geographical dispersion.Brava extrusive carbonatites belong to the younger (probable Holocene \xe2\x80\x93 Pleistocene) volcanic sequence of the island. This feature is unique in the context of Cape Verde geology, because in the other islands (including Brava) of the archipelago carbonatites are commonly assigned to the basal complexes, having formed during a fairly early stage of the emerged evolution of volcanic construction.Compared with the older intrusive s\xc3\xb6vitic rocks occurring at Middle Unit of Brava Island, extrusive facies are more iron and manganese rich and yield higher contents of trace elements like Ba, Th, U, Nb, Pb and REE, but somewhat lower Sr abundances.

Brava extrusive carbonatites yield isotope signatures that are clearly distinct from all other Cape Verde carbonatites, but akin to the Southern Cape Verde silicate rocks.

Records of paleo-weathered crusts are a challenge to identify because they are obscured by subsequent alteration processes and buried by the newly formed volcanic lavas. However, late formed volcanic rocks theoretically could record previously weathered crust via their assimilation and fractional crystallization (AFC) processes. Here, we present a systematic study on major, trace elements and Sr-Nd-Mg isotopes in a suite of Changbaishan early formed basalts and late erupted trachytes from Northeast China. Detailed evidence of field observation, geochemical signature and rhyolite-MELTS simulations suggest that trachytes mainly originated from deep fractional crystallization of basaltic melts. The low abundant trachytes from the stratigraphic layer above the basalts display decoupled MgSr and Nd isotopes. \xce\xb4Mg and Sr/Sr in trachytes range from \xe2\x88\x920.27 up to +0.94\xe2\x80\xb0 (the heaviest isotopic composition ever reported for Mg in the igneous rocks) and 0.70490 to 0.71065, respectively, which are significantly elevated relative to that of their mantle source. However, they preserved mantle source-like Nd/Nd (0.512584 to 0.512656) ratios. These unusual characteristics cannot be explained by thermal diffusion, fractional crystallization or simple crustal contamination processes. Specifically, \xce\xb4Mg correlates positively with SiO and Sr/Sr, and negatively with MgO, CaO, AlO, Sr and Nb/U indicators. The highly elevated Mg and Sr isotopes but limited Nd isotopic changes in trachytes require a component to be the relatively younger weathering residue of basaltic rocks. Taking this component as a wall rock endmember, the well-developed above correlations can be best modelled by AFC processes. This reflects that some trachytes in the aftermath of AFC processes almost fully lost their primary source characteristics, but inherited the intense chemical weathering signature of basalts. This event probably occurred in the middle Miocene as studies of paleosols showed humid and warm climate during that period after the initial eruption of Changbaishan basalts.

Moreover, we demonstrate that the difference in initial Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd isotope compositions between the Neoproterozoic Sarfartoq (Sr/Sr = 0.70278\xe2\x80\x930.70293; \xce\xb5 = + 1.6 to + 3.6; n = 13) and Mesozoic Tikiusaaq (Sr/Sr = 0.70319\xe2\x80\x930.70346; \xce\xb5 = + 4.8 to + 5.1; n = 3) kimberlite fields can be readily explained by isotopic evolution of a common mantle reservoir. This mantle reservoir appears to have continuously participated in global crust\xe2\x80\x93mantle differentiation and recycling, which points to the well-stirred convective upper mantle as the ultimate kimberlite magma source region beneath West Greenland. The apparent geographic shift of kimberlite and associated carbonatite magmatic activity from the craton margin during the Neoproterozoic toward the craton center during the Mesozoic is explained by changes in localized, small-scale mantle flow along the underside of progressively thinning cratonic lithosphere.\xe2\x96\xba Coeval Greenland kimberlites and carbonatites are related to a common carbonate-rich precursor magma. \xe2\x96\xba Perovskite Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd isotope systematics suggest a convective mantle origin for Greenland kimberlites. \xe2\x96\xba Distinct Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd isotope compositions of 550\xe2\x80\x93590 and 158\xe2\x80\x93166 Ma Greenland kimberlites are due to convecting mantle evolution. \xe2\x96\xba First Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd isotope data for Mesozoic Greenland kimberlites",\n        "Chemical Geology",\n        "10.1016/J.CHEMGEO.2012.05.026",\n        "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009254112002653",\n        "2012-08-06"\n    ],\n    [\n        "elsevier_44bd2abd435db2d313b4605d86854e998b451943",\n        "Drastic shift in lava geochemistry in the volcanic-front to rear-arc region of the Southern Kamchatkan subduction zone: Evidence for the transition from slab surface dehydration to sediment melting",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"Geological Institute, University of Copenhagen, \\\\u00d8ster Voldgade 10, 1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark\\", \\"Leibniz Institute for Marine Sciences, IFM-GEOMAR, Division Dynamics of the Ocean Floor, Wischhofstrasse 1-3, 24148 Kiel, Germany$$$Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry (GEOKHI), Russian Academy of Sciences, Kosygin str. 19, Moscow 119991, Russia\\", \\"School of Earth Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington, P.O.

It is somehow linked to an increase of the slab surface depth of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and increasing thickness of the mantle wedge and new constraints for its causes may improve our understanding of magma generation and element recycling in subduction zones in general. As a case study, this paper focuses on the geochemical composition of lavas from two adjacent volcanic centres from the volcanic front (VF) to rear-arc (RA) transition of the Southern Kamchatkan subduction zone, with the aim to examine whether the shift in lava geochemistry is associated with processes in the mantle wedge or in the subducted oceanic lithosphere or both. The trace element and O\xe2\x80\x93Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd\xe2\x80\x93Hf\xe2\x80\x93Pb (double-spike)-isotopic composition of the mafic Mutnovsky (VF) and Gorely (RA) lavas in conjunction with geochemical modelling provides constraints for the degree of partial melting in the mantle wedge and the nature of their slab components. Degrees of partial melting are inferred to be significantly higher beneath Mutnovsky (\xe2\x88\xbc18%) than Gorely (\xe2\x88\xbc10%). The Mutnovsky (VF) slab component is dominated by hydrous fluids, derived from subducted sediments and altered oceanic crust, eventually containing minor but variable amounts of sediment melts. The composition of the Gorely slab component strongly points to a hydrous silicate melt, most likely mainly stemming from subducted sediments, although additional fluid-contribution from the underlying altered oceanic crust (AOC) is likely. Moreover, the Hf\xe2\x80\x93Nd-isotope data combined with geochemical modelling suggest progressive break-down of accessory zircon in the melting metasediments. Therefore, the drastic VF to RA shift in basalt chemistry mainly arises from the transition of the nature of the slab component (from hydrous fluid to melt) in conjunction with decreasing degrees of partial melting within \xe2\x88\xbc15 km across-arc. Finally, systematic variations of key inter-element with high-precision Pb-isotope ratios provide geochemical evidence for a pollution of the Mutnovsky mantle source with Gorely melt components but not vice versa, most likely resulting from trench-ward mantle wedge corner flow. We also present a geodynamic model integrating the location of the Mutnovsky and Gorely volcanic centres and their lava geochemistry with the recently proposed thermal structure of the southern Kamchatkan arc and constraints about phase equilibria in subducted sediments and AOC. Herein, the slab surface hosting the subducted sediments suffers a transition from dehydration to melting above a continuously dehydrating layer of AOC.

The petrogenesis of the Miocene intrusion and its genetic association with Cu mineralization have been debated. This study presents new results on whole rock major and trace elements, Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd isotopes, zircon U\xe2\x80\x93Pb dating, Hf\xe2\x80\x93O isotopic compositions of the Qulong ore-bearing and barren adakites. All the Qulong adakites studied here have low MgO (< 2 wt.%), high KO (between 2 wt.% and 6 wt.%), with KO/NaO ratios ranging from 0.2\xe2\x80\x932.0. The SiO contents are mostly higher than 64 wt.%. These are dramatically different from ore-forming adakites in the circum-Pacific region and other places in general. Ore-bearing adakites have systematically higher SiO and KO compared with barren ones, likely due to the addition of Si and K during alteration and mineralization. Magmatic zircons from these two series of intrusions have U\xe2\x80\x93Pb ages of 16.6 \xc2\xb1 0.5\xe2\x80\x9317.0 \xc2\xb1 0.6 Ma and 16.7 \xc2\xb1 0.3\xe2\x80\x9317.4 \xc2\xb1 0.4 Ma, respectively, which are identical to each other within analytical errors but are systematically older than although marginally overlap with the Re\xe2\x80\x93Os isochron ages of 15.36 \xc2\xb1 0.21\xe2\x80\x9316.41 \xc2\xb1 0.48 Ma. The Qulong porphyries have geochemical characteristics of typical adakites, with Sr = 259\xe2\x80\x931195 ppm, Y = 1.91\xe2\x80\x939.12 ppm, Yb = 0.2\xe2\x80\x930.92 ppm, Sr/Y = 49\xe2\x80\x93202 ppm, and (La/Yb) = 13\xe2\x80\x9349 for both ore-bearing and barren adakites. In a Sr/Y versus (La/Yb) diagram, most of the samples plot in the low part of circum-Pacific field, close to the field defined by Dabie adakites. Some of the ore-bearing adakites even plot in the Dabie adakite field, indicating that both slab melts and lower continental crust melts have been involved. Zircons from the ore-bearing adakites have \xce\xb4O ranging from 5.1 to 7.3\xe2\x80\xb0 (average 6.4\xe2\x80\xb0) and \xce\xb5Hf(t) from 1.9 to 10.4\xe2\x80\xb0, which plot close to MORB. Similarly, zircons from the barren adakite have \xce\xb4O ranging from 4.0 to 7.4\xe2\x80\xb0 (average 6.3\xe2\x80\xb0) and \xce\xb5Hf(t) from 5.6 to 9.3\xe2\x80\xb0, mostly plotting close to MORB values, too. In-situ zircon Hf\xe2\x80\x93O isotopic measurements for the most samples yield a binary mixing trend between mantle- and crustal-derived melts, with mantle-related sources as the main contributor.

The dramatic differences between Qulong and circum-Pacific adakites suggest that either Qulong porphyry Cu deposit is unique, or the ore-bearing adakites are not the ore-forming porphyry. Considering the identical geochemical characteristics of the ore-bearing and barren adakites, the textures (some samples are not porphyry) and the systematically older ages compared to Re\xe2\x80\x93Os isochron ages, the latter is preferred. In contrast to earlier adakitic granites, recently studied porphyries in the central phase of the Qulong deposit have zircon U\xe2\x80\x93Pb ages identical to the Re\xe2\x80\x93Os ages, and thus are more likely to be the ore-forming porphyry.

Zircon UPb dating results revealed that the Langeri and Val\'za plutons were emplaced in the late Eocene at 38\xe2\x80\x9336\xe2\x80\xafMa. Whole-rock elemental data indicate that granitoids are mainly peraluminous S-type with subordinate I-type granites, and all granitic samples show arc-like geochemical affinity.

From comprehensive analyses of regional tectonics, we concluded that the late Eocene granitic rocks were generated in a -collisional tectonic setting, marking the timing for formation of the Sakhalin-Hokkaido orogenic belt. The middle-late Eocene welding of the Okhotsk Sea Plate and the Eurasia Plate is the most plausible mechanism that caused crustal thickening beneath the Sakhalin Island, and anatexis of metasediments and oceanic crustal materials in the lower crust might be responsible for the formation of late Eocene granitic rocks. Considering the Eocene tectonic events in NE Asia, late Paleocene to early Eocene subduction of the Kula-Pacific ridge beneath the Hokkaido Island and Eocene initial rift of pull-apart basins along strike-slip fault system in the Hokkaido and Sakhalin Islands may also contribute to the emplacement of Eocene magmatism in the Sakhalin-Hokkaido orogenic belt.",\n        "Lithos",\n        "10.1016/J.LITHOS.2018.12.002",\n        "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002449371830464X",\n        "2019-01-01"\n    ],\n    [\n        "elsevier_54a38c9082806a51271d46529114eb0621cc564d",\n        "Archaean orogenic ultrapotassic magmatism: an example from the southern Abitibi greenstone belt",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"C.N.R.S., Centre G\\\\u00e9ologique et G\\\\u00e9ophysique, Universit\\\\u00e9 de Montpellier II, Place Eug\\\\u00e8ne Bataillon, 34095 Montpellier Cedex 5, France\\", \\"C.N.R.S., Centre G\\\\u00e9ologique et G\\\\u00e9ophysique, Universit\\\\u00e9 de Montpellier II, Place Eug\\\\u00e8ne Bataillon, 34095 Montpellier Cedex 5, France\\", \\"Department of Geology, Saint Mary\'s University, Halifax, N.S.

The granodiorites are geochemically similar to low-Mg# adakitic rocks and isotopically have enriched Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd\xe2\x80\x93Hf compositions, low radiogenic Pb (Pb/Pb = 16.524\xe2\x80\x9317.017), and mantle-like \xce\xb4O (5.8 \xc2\xb1 0.5\xe2\x80\xb0). They were originated from the thickened lower continental crust (LCC) of the NCC. In contrast, the granites have low Sr/Y (< 20), La/Yb, Dy/Yb, and prominent negative Eu anomalies, indicating their origination at the shallow middle-lower crustal levels. The mafic dykes are enriched in LREE relative to HREE, and exhibit negative anomalies of Nb, Ta, Ti and positive anomalies of Pb. They have low Nb/U, Ce/Pb, high La/Nb, Ba/Nb, enriched Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd isotopic compositions and low radiogenic Pb (Pb/Pb = 16.789 to 17.262), indicating LCC materials involved into the mantle sources. Modeling suggests derivation of the mafic dykes from the depleted upper mantle hybridized by 10\xe2\x80\x9315% recycled LCC. The contrasting chemical characteristics of adakitic rocks and granites imply that recycling of the LCC was likely achieved through rapid foundering at 115\xe2\x80\x93112 Ma, which resulted in thinning of the overlying crust and hybridization of the underlying mantle with closely coeval generation of granitic and basaltic magmas. Anatexis of the pre-existing thickened LCC at 123\xe2\x80\x93115 Ma that attenuated the LCC itself and left the residues denser as a result of felsic (adakitic) melt extraction is proposed to have resulted in gravitational instability and foundering of the lithosphere. Such a temporal sequence of magma generation and processes of lithospheric thinning also occurred on north margin of the NCC and are quite similar to the mountain-root removal beneath the Dabie Orogen in central China. This manifests that previous melting of the LCC is perhaps an important trigger responsible for lithospheric foundering in orogenic belts and cartonic margins, where the lithosphere underwent pre-thickening by continental collisions and had stabilized over a long time.\xe2\x96\xba Early Cretaceous magmatism in Bengbu area shows a formation sequence of adakitic\xe2\x80\x93basaltic\xe2\x80\x93granitic. \xe2\x96\xba The adakitic rocks derived from melting of thickened lower crust and normal granites from the shallow crust. \xe2\x96\xba The mafic dykes originated from the mantle sources hybridized by foundered lower crust. \xe2\x96\xba Lithospheric thinning was accomplished via rapid foundering of lower crust subjected to previous melting. \xe2\x96\xba Widespread extraction of felsic adakitic melts from the lower crust was the major trigger for lithospheric foundering.",\n        "Lithos",\n        "10.1016/J.LITHOS.2011.12.015",\n        "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024493712000023",\n        "2012-03-01"\n    ],\n    [\n        "elsevier_5f3a03832eb09ca847231b17de235981e6259d3b",\n        "Geochemistry and petrogenesis of late Miocene granitoids, Cyclades, southern Aegean: Nature of source components",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"Department of Geochemistry and Economic Geology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Panepistimioupolis, Ano Ilisia 15784 Athens, Greece\\", \\"Department of Geochemistry and Economic Geology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Panepistimioupolis, Ano Ilisia 15784 Athens, Greece\\", \\"Department of Geology, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK\\", \\"NERC Isotope Geoscience Laboratory, Kinglsey Dunham Centre, Keyworth, Nottingham NG12 5GG, UK\\", \\"Department of Geology, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK\\", \\"Department of Mineralogy and Petrology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Panepistimioupolis, Ano Ilisia 15784 Athens, Greece\\"], \\"name\\": [\\"C.

Granitoid plutonism in the Cyclades was established in the mid-Miocene period and lasted until late Miocene (18 to 9 Ma). The timing of granitoid intrusion was associated with the initiation of extensional tectonics in the Aegean. These intrusions form a broad belt about 200 km long running from the west (Lavrium and Serifos) to the eastern Aegean. Both S-type and I-type granitoids are present, the former generally being emplaced earlier than the I-types (~ 15 to 8.3 Ma). Major and trace element variations reveal that three end-member components are involved in the granitoids, but the proportions of these vary in the different plutons. Initial isotopic compositions of all the granitoids are typical of crust-derived magmas from heterogeneous metasedimentary sources (I-type: Sr/Sr = 0.7091\xe2\x80\x930.712, = \xe2\x88\x92 6.4 to \xe2\x88\x92 10.4; S-type: 0.710\xe2\x80\x930715, = \xe2\x88\x92 7.5 to \xe2\x88\x92 10.1). Three end-member sources have been identified: 1) One end-member appears to be a metasedimentary biotite-gneiss (greywacke-type) such as that forming the metamorphic core complexes (Naxos and Paros); this is a dominant (but not the only) component in the S-types. 2a) Major, trace element and Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd isotopic composition correlations of the S-type granitoids with basement gneiss require an extra source of Sr and Ca, having lower initial Sr/Sr indicating a more depleted metasedimentary source at depth, due to possible interaction, of metamorphic fluids with marbles and amphibolites and infiltration through the gneissic units, at mid-crustal levels. 2b) A possible second end-member could be the marble component, as indicated by the buffered values of the Initial Sr isotopic ratios. Major element variation of the mafic microgranular (quartz diorites and tonalites) enclaves are compatible with dehydration melting of a mafic source similar to the amphibolites (island arc tholeiites) at medium pressure (~ 8 kb) conditions. 3) Amphibolite is another end-member which may contribute mostly to the source of the younger intrusions, along the western flank of the arc.",\n        "Lithos",\n        "10.1016/J.LITHOS.2009.09.010",\n        "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024493709003636",\n        "2010-02-01"\n    ],\n    [\n        "elsevier_5fd5c887791bd6aebd53107ff5a229f02401cacf",\n        "Neoproterozoic to Cenozoic magmatism in the central part of the Bohemian Massif (Czech Republic): Isotopic tracking of the evolution of the mantle through the Variscan orogeny",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"Saint Mary\'s University, Department of Geology, 923 Robie Street, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 3C3, Canada\\", \\"St. Francis Xavier University, Department of Earth Sciences, Antigonish, Nova Scotia B2G 2W5, Canada\\", \\"National Taiwan Normal University, Department of Earth Sciences, 88 Tingzhou Road Section 4, Taipei 11677, Taiwan\\", \\"Institute of Geology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Rozvojov\\\\u00e1 269, CZ-165 02 Prague, 6, Czech Republic\\", \\"Na Pet\\\\u0159in\\\\u00e1ch 1897/29, 162 00, Prague 6, Czech Republic\\"], \\"name\\": [\\"Jaroslav Dostal\\", \\"J.

In the TBB, Late Neoproterozoic mafic rocks have highly radiogenic Nd but moderately radiogenic Sr isotopes and were derived from a spinel peridotite mantle. These within-plate rocks were emplaced in an intra-oceanic back-arc basin. Early Paleozoic (Ordovician to Early Devonian) mafic rocks are rift/extension-related, enriched in LREE and Nb relative to HREE and were probably derived from a garnet peridotite mantle source. Compared to Neoproterozoic basalts, their \xc6\x90() values are slightly lower but T model ages are indistinguishable suggesting derivation from a deeper portion of the same mantle source. Thus, the weak deformation and low-grade metamorphism associated with the Cadomian orogeny did not significantly decouple the crust from the underlying mantle source beneath the TBB. Early Paleozoic rift-related mafic rocks of the S-STB and N-MB have comparable isotopic signatures indicating a similar mantle source. Late Paleozoic mafic magmatism occurred during the extensional collapse phase of the Variscan orogen, in the aftermath of the collision between Gondwana and Laurussia. The TBB and S-STB basaltic rocks are within-plate, and transitional between alkaline and tholeiitic compositions but show a relative depletion of Nb. Their isotopic characteristics contrast with older basalts in that they have negative \xc6\x90() values, high initial Sr/Sr ratios and older T model ages (1050 to 1300\xe2\x80\xafMa). Late Paleozoic mantle-derived potassic-ultrapotassic magmas occurring as lamprophyre dikes and small volume high MgK intrusions in N-MB, S-STB and TBB have similar isotopic characteristics suggesting that all these Late Paleozoic rocks were derived from an old CLM contaminated by fluids or silicic melts derived from subducted Precambrian crustal material or alternatively, the region was underthrust by Gondwanan mantle during the Variscan collision. Cenozoic volcanic rocks in the Bohemian Massif are local representatives of the regionally extensive Cenozoic European volcanic province. The rocks are within-plate, alkaline basalts enriched in LREE and Nb and were derived from garnet peridotite mantle. They are significantly more juvenile than Carboniferous-Early Permian mafic rocks, with higher \xc6\x90() values (typically +3 to +5), lower initial Sr/Sr ratios and significantly younger T age.

New geochemical, whole rock Sr-Nd-Pb isotope data and Ar/Ar ages reveal that at least three geochemically and isotopically different tholeiitic dyke generations, with intrusion ages of 135.2 \xc2\xb1 0.7, 124.1 \xc2\xb1 0.8 Ma and 113.0 \xc2\xb1 0.5 Ma, can be distinguished in the M\xc3\xb6we Bay area, Skeleton Coast of northwestern Namibia. Distinct mantle source components were identified in the petrogenesis of the various dyke generations. Magma composition of the two older dyke suites, both of which were emplaced in a tectonic setting dominated by E-W extension, evolved from a within-plate to an enriched mid-ocean ridge basalt type. Contamination by continental crust and/or lithospheric mantel is suggested by a high U/Pb-value (= \xce\xbc) of 9.97, which is typical of the Kalahari Craton. The third dyke generation, which intruded in a tectonic regime dominated by SE-NW extension, corresponds to high-Ti ocean island-type basalt with unradiogenic isotopic compositions derived from a mantle source with a \xce\xbc-value of 9.35.The formation of the older dykes is attributed to the presence of a thermal anomaly in the upper sublithospheric mantle. This anomaly was most likely caused by the peripheral part of a mantle plume that impinged at the base of the lithosphere and caused erosion of the subcontinental mantle lithosphere and melting above the plume head. The initial break-up of SW Gondwana and the formation of early oceanic crust were most likely due to passive rather than active rifting. Continued plume upwelling facilitated by progressive thinning of SW-Gondwana crust led to the formation of the younger, c. 113 Ma old dykes, which are chemically and isotopically identical to coeval rocks from the northeastern portion of the Walvis Ridge and thus are interpreted as onshore expressions of the Tristan-Gough plume head at that time.

The Mo mineralization styles are dominated by porphyry-type, but also contain porphyry-skarn, skarn and porphyry-quartz vein types. Orebodies are vein-type or lensoidal, and are hosted by a variety of metamorphic, volcanic, granitic and sedimentary rocks of different ages. Fluid-rock interactions are exemplified by alteration zonation, which usually grades from an innermost potassic alteration zone, via a silicic/sericite alteration zone, to an outermost propylitic alteration zone. The initial high-temperature ore-forming fluids are magmatic in origin, and contain CO-bearing fluid inclusions. The initial ore-forming fluids would have then evolved to low-temperature, low-pressure, low-salinity and CO-poor (with meteoric water input) at the late alteration/mineralization stage. Causative granitoids for these Mo deposits have relatively high SiO, KO and AlO, and low TiO and MgO, showing a metaluminous to peraluminous high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic affinity. These granitoids exhibit significant depletions in Ba, Nb, Ta, P and Ti, and enrichments in Rb, Th, U and K.

Moderate degrees of olivine and clinopyroxene fractionation under low oxygen fugacities (O) appear to be responsible for the Fe-Ti enrichment in the Group 1 rocks. We propose a model involving plume-subduction interaction to explain the geodynamics and generation of the late Permian mafic magmatism in the CTP.

The Vestfold sequence consists of subalkaline to alkaline basalts, potassic trachybasalts and shoshonites. At Krokskogen B is a subalkaline basalt. The Vestfold basaltic lavas show a relatively wide range in trace element concentrations, and Ta-enriched trace element abundance patterns. Ratios between pairs of incompatible elements show small, but significant variations e.g., Th/Ta: 1.2-1.8. The highest Th/Ta (2.1) is found in the Krokskogen basalt. A Th/Ta of 1.2 is typical of MORB and OIB, whereas the ratio 1.8 is typical of the lower crust. This variation in Th/Ta is not linked to trace element concentrations, but is accompanied by a regular shift in age-corrected , and from + 4.1, \xe2\x88\x9210 and +19.2 to \xe2\x88\x921, +18 and +17.7, respectively.The observed variations in incompatible element ratios, initial isotopic ratios and trace element concentrations are interpreted as follows: The basaltic magmas which gave rise to the Vestfold and Krokskogen lavas originated in lithospheric mantle, which was mildly depleted with respect to Nd-Sr isotopic ratios but relatively rich in radiogenic Pb (PREMA-type). These magmas were retained in the lower crust where they crystallized ol + cpx; some of the magmas were also contaminated.

The emplacement of the LBG was synchronous with the production of abundant migmatites within Thor\xe2\x80\x93Odin dome of the Monashee complex, an exposure of North American basement, exhumed from depths of ca. 26\xe2\x80\x9333 km by Eocene extensional faults. The LBG and the leucosome in migmatites from Thor\xe2\x80\x93Odin dome have similar major and trace element patterns, and are both characterized by zircons which have inherited Precambrian cores. Whole rock Nd isotope compositions show a range of values for the LBG with Nd values from \xe2\x88\x92 5.0 to \xe2\x88\x92 17.2. The Nd for the leucosome samples range from \xe2\x88\x92 9.5 to \xe2\x88\x92 23.6, overlapping with those of the granitic suite. These data support the interpretation of a genetic link between formation of the LBG suite and melting of North American basement rocks, such as those exposed in the core of Thor\xe2\x80\x93Odin dome. The leucosome samples have lower high field strength element (HFSE) concentrations and positive Eu anomalies, whereas the LBG samples have higher HFSE concentrations and negative Eu anomalies. The similar trace element characteristics suggest that the leucosome from the migmatites and the LBG are related, whereby most of the leucosome samples are cumulates and the LBG samples represent evolved or residual melts. The initial Sr/Sr isotope values for both the LBG and leucosome samples have a large range. However, the initial Sr isotopic ratios for the LBG suite are lower than those of the leucosome samples, with Sr/Sr ranging from 0.70603 to 0.73688 and 0.74256 to 0.76593, respectively. This isotopic discrepancy suggests either: a) isotopic disequilibrium during partial melting in the mid- to lower crust where the leucosome formed, b) the distribution of Sr during partial melting was controlled by different melt-producing reactions, and/or c) isotopic heterogeneity in the source rocks. At least part of the LBG suite likely formed via melting of North American basement rocks that were dominantly of sedimentary origin. Melting of the Proterozoic supracrustal metasedimentary rocks overlying North American basement may also have contributed to the formation of the different phases of the suite found at the regional scale.

This paper reports the first detailed geological, geochemical and chronological data from felsic tuffs interbedded with late Cretaceous turbidites in the Southern Zone of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt.Individual tuff layers are thin, mostly < 2 m in thickness, implying that these are dominantly air-fall tuffs. Petrographic data indicate that the felsic tuffs, which exhibit various degrees of alteration, can be classified as crystal-rich and crystal-poor tuffs. The crystal-poor tuffs consist mainly of 45\xe2\x80\x9365% devitrified glass shards and 10\xe2\x80\x9320% broken quartz crystals, whereas the crystal-rich tuffs consist of > 50% crystals. The zircon U\xe2\x80\x93Pb data show three statistically distinct ages at 84, 81 and 77 Ma, with uncertainties of about 1 Ma, suggesting that tuff-forming late Cretaceous magmatism started about 84 Ma ago and was episodically active over a minimum of 7 Ma. The age data also indicate that the average accumulation rate of the turbiditic sequence that hosts the felsic tuffs remained constant between 36 and 40 cm/10 ky. Their enrichment in LIL and LRE elements relative to HFS and HRE elements, and also strongly negative Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies, are consistent with those of magmas generated by subduction-related processes.

Continental subduction has also been proposed to responsible for the formation of the Cenozoic intracontinental potassic rocks widespread in Tibet and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. However, such ancient continental subduction only occasionally been identified and is controversial. In this contribution, we explore the use of boron and its isotopes, to provide new constraints on the origin of newly identified Eocene potassium-rich volcanic rocks in northern Tibet and potential subduction of continental crust. Our results indicate that the latest Eocene (ca. 34 Ma) potassium-rich volcanic rocks are characterised by moderate silica, adakite-like trace elements, enriched Sr-Nd-Pb and light boron isotope (\xce\xb4B = \xe2\x88\x9220.12\xe2\x80\xb0 to \xe2\x88\x927.95\xe2\x80\xb0) signatures. This isotopically light signature of boron suggests a m\xc3\xa9lange source composed of mantle wedge peridotite and recycled dehydrated continental crust. The Eocene potassium-rich magmas were likely derived from low-degree partial melting of diapir m\xc3\xa9lange at high-pressure and medium temperature within subduction channel. Our work indicates potential obduction of the Tibetan plate over the Asian plate thus triggering intracontinental subduction before the end of Eocene. This continental obduction may have accommodated a huge amount of crustal material during Cenozoic rapid convergence between India and Asia. We conclude that during this process an isotopically light component is likely to have been transported into the mantle to form a distinct source region.

These relationships indicate at least two-component magma mixing between (1) magma resulting from a small melting from a depleted mantle and (2) magma resulting from a relatively large amount of melting of an enriched mantle source. It is suggested that the Cenozoic alkaline basalts from southwestern Japan, Korea and China are product of interaction between a MORB-type mantle and a deep mantle plume.If the mantle plume has ascended from the upper mantle-lower mantle or core-mantle boundary, the subducted Pacific and Philippine Sea plates could not have extended to southwestern Japan.

Evidence of superimposed metasomatic effects can be attributed to at least two metasomatizing agents with distinct chemical and isotopic compositions. The first was a silica-undersaturated alkaline melt, resulting in variable Light Rare Earth Elements (LREE) and Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd isotopic enrichment (Sr/Sr=0.70213\xe2\x80\x930.70476; Nd/Nd=0.51339\xe2\x80\x930.51250) from Depleted Mantle (DM) to Enriched Mantle (EMI) end-members. This predominant metasomatism did not form hydrous phases, secondary textures, or significant mineralogical changes, and appears to be compositionally analogous to that recorded in xenoliths and Alpine peridotite massifs of the Southern European lithospheric mantle. The second metasomatic agent was a silica-oversaturated hydrous melt, producing local (<5\xe2\x80\x9310%) mantle hybridization, with the formation of amphibole/phlogopite-bearing opx-rich harzburgites containing olivine\xe2\x80\x93orthopyroxenite and gabbronorite lenses. This metasomatism is characterized by Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd isotopic values representing the most extreme enriched signature (Sr/Sr=0.70672\xe2\x80\x930.70856; Nd/Nd=0.51213\xe2\x80\x930.51211) found in uncontaminated anorogenic basic magmas and associated mantle xenoliths throughout Europe. These Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd isotopic data closely approach those recorded in the Miocene calc-alkaline and potassic volcanism of the Betic Cordillera, suggesting that this signature could have been inherited from subduction-derived metasomatizing melts during the Tertiary orogenic events of the Betic\xe2\x80\x93Alboran region. The incompatible element distribution of these xenoliths and their constituent pyroxenes is also quite unusual, showing chondrite-normalized upward convex Middle (M)REE patterns coupled with remarkable negative Sr and Eu anomalies. Incompatible element modeling indicates that the peculiar composition of clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and plagioclase can be accounted for by the interaction between the peridotite matrix and potassic silica-oversaturated melts, approaching lamproites found in the Betic Cordillera. A comparison with analogous worldwide occurrences indicates that some distinctive characteristics of subduction-related metasomatism in mantle materials are (1) silica-oversaturation in the form of excess orthopyroxene crystallization, in association with hydrous phases; (2) high Sr/Sr ratios, departing from the anorogenic mantle array; (3) particularly high Sr/Sr and low Nd/Nd ratios, coupled with strong negative Sr and Eu anomalies, indicating a significant contribution of continental terrigenous components in the source of subduction-related metasomatizing agents.",\n        "Lithos",\n        "10.1016/J.LITHOS.2003.12.015",\n        "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024493704000192",\n        "2004-07-01"\n    ],\n    [\n        "elsevier_a27d7e462a8471e4499851b1fa8c7249211d56d0",\n        "Cambro-Ordovician Magmatism in SE Brazil: U-Pb and Rb-Sr Ages, Combined with Sr and Nd Isotopic Data of Charnockitic Rocks from the Varzea Alegre Complex",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"Dept. of Geology, IGEO - Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Cidade Universit\\\\u00e1ria, 21949-900, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil$$$National Research Council (CNPq)\\", \\"Institute of Geosciences, University of Bras\\\\u00edlia (UnB), Bras\\\\u00edlia, Brazil\\", \\"Institute of Geosciences, University of S\\\\u00e3o Paulo(USP), S\\\\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil$$$National Research Council (CNPq)\\", \\"IMPG - Institut f\\\\u00fcr Mineralogie, Petrologie und Geochemie der LMU, University of Munich, Germany$$$National Research Council (CNPq)\\"], \\"name\\": [\\"Julio Cezar Mendes\\", \\"Silvia Regina de Medeiros\\", \\"Ian McReath\\", \\"Cristina Maria Pinheiro de Campos\\"]}",\n        "In the central-southern region of Esp\xc3\xadrito Santo State, southeastern Brazil, several granitoids with a variable composition intruded high-grade metamorphic rocks, in the northern segment of the Ribeira fold belt.

Total PGE abundances in the Hongge samples are extremely low, ranging from 0.5 to 10 ppb.

The latter have been hypothesised to fractionate Mo isotopes through interaction with the oceanic crust and carry an isotopically heavy signal that is transferred to the source of arc magmas. Thus, understanding Mo isotope systematics in subduction zones requires characterising the Mo isotope composition of slab-derived fluids and their influence on the Mo isotope budget of arc magmas. However, Mo isotope data reported to date show a considerable influence from subducted sediments that complicate accurate constraints being placed on the fluid contribution. We present Mo isotope data for mafic lavas from the Izu arc, a highly depleted oceanic island arc whose magma compositions show a dominant control from slab-derived fluids. The lavas from the Izu volcanic front are isotopically heavier than MORB and the depleted mantle. Their \xce\xb4Mo (the relative difference in measured Mo/Mo to NIST 3134) systematically varies with indicators for fluid-mobile element enrichment, suggesting that slab-derived fluids in the Izu arc have heavy Mo isotope compositions. Additionally, co-variations with radiogenic Nd/Nd and Hf/Hf point to a relationship between the addition of aqueous fluids and compositional heterogeneity of the sub-arc mantle. We present mass balance models that show that the influence of subduction zone fluids on the trace element pattern of arc magmas is more dominant when these are added to a more depleted and refractory sub-arc mantle, which preferentially melts due to a relatively higher fluid flux. The mass balance of Mo in the Izu arc predicts a light Mo isotope composition for the residual oceanic crust as a result of the preferential removal of isotopically heavy Mo during slab dehydration, consistent with previous suggestions for the Mariana arc and isotopically light Mo previously reported for eclogites.",\n        "Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta",\n        "10.1016/J.GCA.2020.07.043",\n        "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016703720304816",\n        "2020-11-01"\n    ],\n    [\n        "elsevier_a8bda85cdb1f57ced535b02591459742f79d2f7c",\n        "Geochemical and B\xe2\x80\x93Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd isotopic evidence for mingling and mixing processes in the magmatic system that fed the Astroni volcano (4.1\xe2\x80\x933.8 ka) within the Campi Flegrei caldera (southern Italy)",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pisa, Italy\\", \\"Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, \\\\u201cUniversity Federico II\\\\u201d, Napoli, Italy$$$Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Osservatorio Vesuviano, Napoli, Italy\\", \\"Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Osservatorio Vesuviano, Napoli, Italy\\", \\"Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Osservatorio Vesuviano, Napoli, Italy\\", \\"Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Osservatorio Vesuviano, Napoli, Italy\\"], \\"name\\": [\\"Sonia Tonarini\\", \\"Massimo D\'Antonio\\", \\"Mauro Antonio Di Vito\\", \\"Giovanni Orsi\\", \\"Antonio Carandente\\"]}",\n        "The Astroni volcano was built through seven eruptions that generated pyroclastic deposits and lava domes within the Campi Flegrei caldera (southern Italy) 4.1\xe2\x80\x933.8 ka BP.

The Sr, Nd and B isotopic composition of whole rocks is variable and correlated with the degree of chemical evolution, suggesting open-system processes in addition to fractional crystallisation. Moreover, significant Sr-isotopic disequilibrium between the phenocrysts and glass has been documented for one sample.The chemostratigraphy of the products indicates that Astroni eruptions 1 through 5 were fed by magmas of trachytic to phonolitic composition that were less enriched in radiogenic Sr and B up-section. This variability has been interpreted as the result of mingling between at least two distinct magmatic end-members, one more evolved and the other less evolved.

An abrupt decrease in both the Sr isotope ratio and the Th content, detected at the transition between Unit 4 and 5, suggests that another magma with a Sr/Sr ratio intermediate between those of the two identified end-members may have been involved in Astroni activity. The more evolved end-member is interpreted as a residue of the Agnano\xe2\x80\x93Monte Spina eruption that was invaded by either the intermediate or the less evolved magmatic end-member, promoting mingling and triggering Astroni activity.This study of Astroni provides insights for both short- and long-term volcanic hazard assessment, as the Astroni volcano is the best example of a very close sequence of eruptions from the same vent area in the Campi Flegrei caldera.",\n        "Lithos",\n        "10.1016/J.LITHOS.2008.09.012",\n        "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024493708002223",\n        "2009-02-01"\n    ],\n    [\n        "elsevier_ab214e9656361cd483d370c5151ae187a897e749",\n        "Magmatism and the geodynamics of rifting of the Pripyat-Dnieper-Donets rift, East European Platform",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"Department of Earth Sciences, Leeds University, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK\\", \\"Institute of Fossil Fuels and Endogenous Processes, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Lvov, Ukraine\\"], \\"name\\": [\\"Marjorie Wilson\\", \\"Zoya M.

Hornblende Ar/Ar dating yielded a plateau age of 216.01 \xc2\xb1 10.64 Ma.

Our samples exhibit moderate fractionation in LREE patterns approximately 100 times that of chondrite but HREE abundances less than 10 times that of chondrite.

The enrichment process is related to metasomatism of a subcontinental lithospheric mantle source, which is caused by a large quantity of HO-rich fluids, rather than sediments released from oceanic crust at depth during the closure of the Paleotethys Ocean in Triassic times. All of the geochemical data and the trace element modeling suggest that the primary magma of the calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline spessartites was generated at depth by a low degree of partial melting (~ 1\xe2\x80\x9310%) of a previously enriched lithospheric mantle wedge consisting of phlogopite-bearing spinel peridotite. The ascendance of a hot asthenosphere triggered by extensional events caused partial melting of mantle material. The rising melts were accompanied by fractional crystallization and crustal contamination en route to the surface. All of the geochemical features combined with regional data suggest that the Eastern Pontides calc-alkaline lamprophyres originated in an extensional environment along an active continental margin throughout the Late Triassic.

However, our results indicate that considerable amounts of these early Paleozoic granites have characteristics of both S- and I-type granites. Thus, we propose to divide these granites into two groups: fewer of them are Group A with relatively high () values (clustering within \xe2\x88\x92 3.0 to + 9.0) and () values (\xe2\x88\x92 5.2 to + 1.3) as well as higher initial temperatures at 810\xe2\x80\x93850 \xc2\xb0C, and most of them are Group B with relatively low () values (clustering within \xe2\x88\x92 16.0 to \xe2\x88\x92 1.0) and () values (\xe2\x88\x92 13.2 to \xe2\x88\x92 4.1) as well as relatively low initial temperatures at 700\xe2\x80\x93830 \xc2\xb0C.

These two granites are characterized by high SiO (between 67.59 and 74.87 wt.%), metaluminous to peraluminous (A/CNK = 0.96\xe2\x80\x931.48) compositions, and a negative correlation between PO and SiO. Their biotites belong to magnesium biotites, indicating that they have partial features of either I- or S-type granites. Duntou granodiorites exhibit higher () values (clustering within + 1 to + 8) and () values (\xe2\x88\x92 3.0 to + 1.1) while Xiawan monzogranites show relatively low () values (clustering within \xe2\x88\x92 1 to + 5) and () values (\xe2\x88\x92 5.0 to \xe2\x88\x92 3.7).

Yuechengling porphyritic amphibole-bearing biotite granites in this batholith contain abundant amphibole, indicating that they are I-type granites.

Petrographic data reveal that the igneous mineralogy has been altered during post-magmatic hydrothermal alteration processes corresponding to greenschist- to lower amphibolite facies conditions with rarely preserved primary olivine and orthopyroxene. A 16-point Sm\xe2\x80\x93Nd whole-rock isochron gives an age of 3352 \xc2\xb1 110 Ma for the timing of eruption of komatiite lavas. About 60% of the studied komatiite samples show Al-depletion whilst the remaining are Al-undepleted. The Al-depleted komatiites are characterised by high CaO/AlO ratios (1.01\xe2\x80\x931.34) and low AlO/TiO (5\xe2\x80\x9316) whereas Al-undepleted komatiites show lower CaO/AlO ratios (0.59\xe2\x80\x930.99) and higher AlO/TiO (17\xe2\x80\x9326). Trace element distribution patterns of komatiites suggest that most of the primary geochemical and Nd isotopic compositions are preserved with only minor influence of post-magmatic alteration processes and negligible crustal contamination. The chemical characteristics of Al-depleted komatiites, such as high (Gd/Yb) together with lower HREE, Y, Zr and Hf, imply their derivation from deeper upper mantle with garnet (majorite?) involvement, whereas lower (Gd/Yb) slightly higher HREE, Y, Zr and Hf suggest derivation from shallower upper mantle without garnet involvement. The observed chemical characteristics (CaO/AlO, AlO/TiO, MgO, Ni, Cr, Nb, Zr, Y, Hf, REE) indicate derivation of the komatiite magmas from different depths in a plume setting, whereas sub-contemporaneous felsic volcanism and TTG accretion can be attributed to an arc setting. In order to explain the spatial association of komatiite volcanism with contemporaneous mafic-felsic volcanism and TTG accretion we propose a combined plume-arc setting.

The latest stages of the evolution of the complex are characterized by several nelsonite (magnetite\xe2\x80\x93apatite rock) and carbonatite dykes, plugs and veins crosscutting earlier alkaline rocks. The interaction between the latter and late-stage carbonatites and/or carbo-hydrothermal fluids, converted the original dunites and bebedourites to metasomatic phlogopitites. Late-stage nelsonites (N1), pseudonelsonites (N2) and various types of dolomite carbonatites (DC) including norsethite-, magnesite- and/or monazite-bearing varieties show significant whole-rock Nd and Sr isotopic variations. To elucidate whether magmatic or metasomatic processes, or both, were responsible for these isotope variations we characterized the Nd and Sr isotope compositions of major mineral phases (i.e. apatite, dolomite, norsethite, pyrochlore and tetraferriphlogopite) in these late-stage rocks. Mineral isotope data recorded the same differences observed between N1 and N2 whole-rocks with N2 minerals showing more enriched isotopic signatures than minerals from N1. Sr isotopic disequilibrium among minerals from N2 pseudonelsonites and spatially related dolomite carbonatite pockets implies formation from batches of carbonate melts with distinct isotopic compositions. A detailed investigation of Nd and Sr isotopes from whole-rocks and minerals suggests that the most evolved rocks of the Catal\xc3\xa3o I complex probably derive from two different evolution paths. We propose that an earlier magmatic trend (path A) could be explained by several batches of immiscible and/or residual melts derived from carbonated-silicate parental magma (e.g. phlogopite picrite) contaminated with continental crust to a variable extent, in an AFCLI-like process.

The western Luliang Uplift offers a critical window to address this problem. In this study, based on seismic profiles and geophysical interpretation of the western Luliang Uplift, and from new geochronological and geochemical data, we evaluate the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the region. The western Luliang Uplift is composed of Carboniferous basalt, andesite and dacite interbedded with multiple layers of siltstone and mudstone. Zircon U\xe2\x80\x93Pb isotopic data indicate that these rocks coevally erupted in 323\xe2\x80\x93327 Ma. Seismic profile across the tectonic belt shows that the western Luliang Uplift experienced a structural inversion from Carboniferous extension to latest Carboniferous\xe2\x80\x93Early Permian compression. The basalts and andesites show tholeiitic to calc-alkaline affinity, high \xce\xb5(t) (6.4\xe2\x80\x938.0) and low initial Sr/Sr (0.703497\xe2\x80\x930.704826), relative enrichment in LILEs and REEs, and depletion in HFSEs, especially Nb, Ta and Ti.

These features indicate that the basaltic rocks and dacites were derived from partial melting of a depleted mantle modified by slab-derived fluids and a juvenile lower crust respectively in an island arc environment during the Early Carboniferous. Furthermore, these coeval volcanic rocks show a temporal variation of tholeiitic to calc-alkaline series in the south to calc-alkaline to shoshonitic series in the north, together with extensional deformation and formation of the volcano-sedimentary sequence. These features suggest that the western Luliang Uplift was dominated by northward subduction with forearc and intra-arc basin in the Early Carboniferous. The Middle Permian terrigenous strata unconformably overlie the Early Carboniferous strata, indicating that the ocean basin might have closed during the Early Permian. Similarities in the tectonostratigraphic evolution show that the western Luliang Uplift and southern West Junggar terrane share a common tectonic evolution from Carboniferous subduction\xe2\x80\x93accretion process to Early Permian amalgamation, further confirming the Luliang Uplift as an important link between the East and West Junggar terranes.",\n        "Gondwana Research",\n        "10.1016/J.GR.2014.08.019",\n        "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1342937X14002809",\n        "2015-04-01"\n    ],\n    [\n        "elsevier_c001ddab6adf32bfa308383ba7c883639881b6b8",\n        "A mildly depleted upper mantle beneath southeast Norway: evidence from basalts in the Permo-Carboniferous Oslo Rift",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"Mineralogisk-Geologisk Museum, Sarsgt. 1, 0562 Oslo 5 Norway\\", \\"Mineralogisk-Geologisk Museum, Sarsgt. 1, 0562 Oslo 5 Norway\\", \\"Amoco Norway Oil P.O.

The Vestfold sequence consists of subalkaline to alkaline basalts, potassic trachybasalts and shoshonites. At Krokskogen B is a subalkaline basalt. The Vestfold basaltic lavas show a relatively wide range in trace element concentrations, and Ta-enriched trace element abundance patterns. Ratios between pairs of incompatible elements show small, but significant variations e.g., Th/Ta: 1.2-1.8. The highest Th/Ta (2.1) is found in the Krokskogen basalt. A Th/Ta of 1.2 is typical of MORB and OIB, whereas the ratio 1.8 is typical of the lower crust.

These magmas were retained in the lower crust where they crystallized ol + cpx; some of the magmas were also contaminated. The highest degree of contamination is seen in the lower part of the Vestfold sequence and in the Krokskogen basalt. At the present level of information about the Oslo Rift (no data are available for its southern, submerged part), rift magmatism appears to be dominated by a PREMA source in the pre-rift lower lithosphere.

The igneous protoliths of eclogites and garnet amphibolites were probably generated from a mantle source that had components of both a depleted mantle modified by slab-released fluid (as seen in a negative Nb anomaly) and an enriched mantle, similar to that of ocean island basalts (OIB). Fractional crystallization modeling indicates that the protoliths of some garnet clinopyroxenites from the Iratsu body are cumulates from a basaltic magma that crystallized under high O and HO fugacities in the middle to lower crust.

The Main Uralian Fault zone (MUF), the east-dipping suture of the orogen containing low-grade metamorphic rocks, separates the Sysert Complex in the east from the Ufaley Complex in the west. The Sysert Complex in the hanging wall of the MUF consists of intensely deformed gneisses, granitic intrusions and a metamorphosed m\xc3\xa9lange zone. Tectonic and isotopic investigations suggest the following stages for the evolution of the Sysert Complex: (a) pre-orogenic rifting and magmatism during Ordovician and Silurian times; (b) oceanic closure, island arc formation related to convergence and subduction during Devonian times; (c) major ductile deformation under amphibolite facies conditions related to NW-directed thrusting associated with crustal stacking during collision in Carboniferous times; (d) exhumation and contractional intracontinental tectonics during Permian times; and (e) closing of isotope systems related to cooling and the end of orogenic shortening through Triassic times. The Ufaley Complex, in the footwall of the MUF, is interpreted as an east-dipping crustal stack that records an amphibolite facies Uralian metamorphism. Lithologically the complex can be divided into pre-orogenic European basement (West Ufaley) and intensely deformed Palaeozoic metasediments and amphibolites (East Ufaley). High-pressure relics in the East Ufaley Complex are interpreted to be the result of subduction, whereas intense ductile deformation is related to overthrusting onto West Ufaley. The West Ufaley Complex is composed of gneisses, amphibolites, migmatites and granitic intrusions and has been thrust onto Devonian limestones along a major shear zone. In both Sysert and Ufaley Complexes, NW-trending stretching lineations and top-to-the-NW kinematic indicators suggest an oblique plate convergence with a significant sinistral component.

The Qitianling granite batholith is a multi-staged composite pluton with three phases (Cailing, Furong, and Huangtangling) according to their ages and petrography. The Cailing (163\xe2\x80\x93160 Ma) and Furong (157\xe2\x80\x93153 Ma) phases are mainly composed of porphyritic amphibole\xe2\x80\x93biotite monzogranite, and they share similar geochemical and isotopic characteristics. Both of them show similar SiO contents from 66.50 to 70.28%, and metaluminous A/CNK values of 0.80 to 0.98. The granites are characterized by high contents of large ion lithosphile elements (LILE) such as Rb, Th, U, Pb; high field strength elements (HFSE) such as Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf; and Zr + Nb + Ce + Y contents > 350 ppm, and high 10,000 \xe2\x88\x97 Ga/Al ratios > 2.6. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns show relative enrichment of light rare earth elements (LREEs) and significant negative Eu anomalies. Mineralogical and geochemical features suggest that the Cailing and Furong granites are A-type, which can be further classified as A subtype. They have relatively lower (Sr/Sr) ratios (0.7091\xe2\x80\x930.7132), higher \xce\xb5(t) values (\xe2\x88\x92 5.5 to \xe2\x88\x92 7.6) and younger Nd isotopic model ages (1.48\xe2\x80\x931.56 Ga) than those common S-type granites in South China.

The late Cenozoic Tengchong Volcanic Field (TVF), located in the Yunnan Province Northeast of the Himalayas, comprises a cluster of mafic continental intraplate lavas, represented by 68 volcanic cones and spanning an area of ca. 800\xe2\x80\xafkm. Major and trace element data and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope ratios of 18 newly sampled rocks from the area are used to identify the composition of their source in the SCLM. Indices of magmatic differentiation are correlated with isotope composition, marking a classic case of assimilation-fractional-crystallization (AFC) during petrogenesis. The most primitive samples, identified on the basis of element and isotope compositions, are interpreted to be directly derived from the metasomatised mantle underneath south-western China. Modelling of a best-fit scenario indicates that the isotope and trace element character of these samples can be reproduced by ca. 1% partial melting of a metasomatised mantle source, composed of depleted MORB mantle infused with 1% addition of a bulk global subducting sediment (GLOSS) component.

The origin of the isotopic signatures is ascribed to modifications of parent-daughter ratios in the SCLM by past subduction-related metasomatism, possibly in the form of sediment m\xc3\xa9lange diapirs. This implied that the mantle source of TVF lavas is not, as previously proposed, related to enriched geochemical reservoirs (EM-1, EM-2) associated with mantle plume activity or to so-called Dupal or Indian asthenospheric mantle. Instead, it is argued that time-integrated parent-daughter fractionation occurred long before India-Asia collision and this produced reservoirs with isotopic compositions that resemble some but not all aspects of the Dupal isotope signature.

Whole-rock Nd and Ar/Ar analysis of rocks throughout the region, when compared with the geodynamic models suggest that nickel and gold mineralization in the Halls Creek Orogen can be related to basin development and subsequent basin closure during the convergence of North Australian Craton and Kimberley Craton, respectively. Whole-rock Nd analysis confirmed the input of juvenile melts in the centre of the orogen before the 1835\xe2\x80\x931805 Ma Halls Creek Orogeny, supporting the upwelling of decompression mantle melts during the basin development. These analyses also revealed the spatial links between nickel and gold mineralization and lithological units with positive \xce\xb5Nd values.

The results of geodynamic models, geophysical interpretation, and isotopic analysis are used to understand the critical processes in the gold and nickel mineralization, which are presented by predictor maps. The GIS-based knowledge-driven fuzzy logic method used to integrate the predictor maps and create the prospectivity maps. Herein we show that mafic-ultramafic units prospective for nickel mineralization formed by upwelling of decompression mantle melt during crustal thinning and extension during basin development, and typically consist of the most juvenile magmas in the region. Whereas, gold deposits formed during the compressional regime and basin closure, and are located along a major shear zone separating two terranes. This deep crustal-scale shear zone is implied to be the site of multiple stages of deformation that acted as fluid migration pathways during basin closure and subsequent collision.

The tholeiitic gabbros originated from a mantle source that had been metasomatized during subduction beneath the Cadomian magmatic arc at c. 570 Ma, which led to enrichment of LREE, Ba/Nb, and LILE relative to primitive mantle.

The corresponding magmatic products include basaltic lava flows erupted within wide synclines and intrusive complexes composed of layered mafic intrusions and monzonitic to syenitic dykes emplaced along narrow anticlinal ridges. The igneous rock sequence within the intrusive complexes is composed of troctolites, olivine-gabbros, oxide-gabbros, monzonites and syenites. The chemical compositions of the various intrusive rocks can be accounted for by crystal accumulation, fractional crystallization and post-magmatic remobilization. The evolution from the troctolites to the syenites was mainly controlled by a fractional crystallization process marked by early fractionation of olivine, plagioclase and clinopyroxene, followed by separation of biotite, amphibole, apatite, and Ti-magnetite. Hydrothermal activity associated with emplacement of the intrusions within the Jurassic limestones modified the elemental and the Sr isotopic composition of the hydrothermally altered rocks In particular the monzonitic to syenitic dykes underwent an alkali metasomatism marked by depletion in K and Rb and enrichment in Na and Sr. As a result, their Sr isotopic composition was shifted towards higher initial Sr isotopic ratios (0.7067\xe2\x80\x930.7075) with respect to the associated gabbros (0.7036\xe2\x80\x930.7046).

To the north and south this peak is flanked by \xe2\x88\xbc 300 km long, isotopically homogeneous sections of ridge with higher (\xe2\x88\xbc +10.9) and lower (\xe2\x88\xbc 0.7024) and (\xe2\x88\xbc 18.1). Although otherwise similar, these two sections differ from each other slightly in their and ratios. The isotopic peak corresponds to a region of greater axial cross-sectional area, but axial bathymetry and physical segmentation appear generally unrelated to mantle isotopic composition. However, an abrupt break in isotopic ratios does occur at the large, > 3 Ma, southward-propagating overlapping spreading center at 20.7\xc2\xb0S, which marks the end of the south limb or flank of the isotopic peak. The peak itself appears to be a manifestation of large-scale binary mixing between material possessing at least mildly plume-like Nd, Pb, and Sr isotopic characteristics (most abundant at \xe2\x88\xbc 17\xe2\x80\x9317.5\xc2\xb0S) and two slightly different high- mantle end-members equivalent to those north of 15.8\xc2\xb0S and south of 20.7\xc2\xb0S. Helium isotopes also define a prominent along-axis peak, but it spans a much narrower range of latitude and is offset slightly to the north of those for Nd, Sr and Pb isotopes. The combined results suggest that a discrete mantle heterogeneity may be entering into the melt zone near 15.8\xc2\xb0S and migrating southward as far as the 20.7\xc2\xb0S overlapping spreading center.Isotopic variability at short length scales is very limited throughout the entire 13\xe2\x80\x9323\xc2\xb0S region. It cannot be solely a result of homogenization by petrogenetic processes, because there is a lack of corresponding uniformity in ratios of highly to moderately incompatible elements; also, isotopes do not correlate with major element indicators of degree of partial melting or differentiation, or, in general, with the secondary magmatic segmentation thought to reflect different partial melting domains. Therefore, the subaxial mantle must be isotopically well-mixed relative to the scale of melting. In part, this probably reflects: (1) a larger of melting per unit length of ridge; and (2) a greater flow of mantle into the subaxial melt zone at super-fast spreading; but also must represent (3) a reduced amount of real isotopic variability in the shallow asthenosphere, as emphasized by the regional isotopic uniformity north and south of the isotopic peak. Such large-scale homogeneity could be a result of enhanced convective asthenospheric mixing over a long period of time. It could also reflect a low, long-term input of continental, lithospheric, recycled slab, or plume-type material into the regional asthenosphere.Largely independent of the north-south isotopic patterns is a fairly regular, southward depletion in highly incompatible elements such as Rb and Nb, superimposed on which is sizable local variability. Because ratios of highly to moderately incompatible elements show little or no correlation with major-element indicators of degree of melting, much of the variation in highly incompatible elements must be caused by a different (probably larger) volume of mantle than that conferring the major element signatures, or by one (or more) event that preceded the main melting episode in the not too ancient past.",\n        "Earth and Planetary Science Letters",\n        "10.1016/0012-821X(94)90039-6",\n        "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0012821X94900396",\n        "1994-01-01"\n    ],\n    [\n        "elsevier_f439618ce779f7311a69b5c84b4bcae95b02c1f0",\n        "Re\xe2\x80\x93Os isotopic compositions of picrites from the Emeishan flood basalt province, China",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing, 100083, China\\", \\"CAS Key Laboratory of Crust\\\\u2013Mantle Materials and Environment, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, China\\", \\"CAS Key Laboratory of Crust\\\\u2013Mantle Materials and Environment, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, China\\", \\"Department of Geology, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK\\", \\"Department of Geology, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK\\"], \\"name\\": [\\"Zhaochong Zhang\\", \\"Xiachen Zhi\\", \\"Lei Chen\\", \\"Andrew D.

Eighteen geochemically well characterised samples, including 12 picrites and 6 basalts from two sections near Lijiang, have been analyzed for Os isotopes. The picrites from the two sections have overlapping Re and Os concentrations and initial Os isotopic compositions. They have higher Os concentrations (1.5\xe2\x80\x933 parts per billion), and slightly lower Re concentrations (< 0.07 ppb) than those from many other flood basalt provinces (FBPs) and ocean island picrites. The picrites have distinctly unradiogenic Os isotopes with () values ( = 259 Ma) of \xe2\x88\x92 0.9 to \xe2\x88\x92 2.4, but the associated basalts have suprachondritic Os isotope compositions with () of 1.8 to 73.3, which overlap with published data for basalts from other localities in the province. The high () values of the basalts could be the result of crustal contamination, which is enabled by the low Os concentrations in the parental basalts.

Most Silurian\xe2\x80\x93Devonian granites in South China are S-type or I-type granites, which are suggested to be petrogenetically related to the Wuyi\xe2\x80\x93Yunkai orogeny. This paper firstly reported a systematic study on two Devonian A-type granites in the central Jiangxi Province. LA-ICP-MS zircon U\xe2\x80\x93Pb dating results imply that the Huitong and Epo granites were emplaced at about 415 Ma. Both of the two granites have the petrographic and geochemical characteristics of A-type granites. Interstitial biotites occur along the boundary of euhedral plagioclase and quartz and they formed later than plagioclase and quartz. It implies that the primary magma could have been anhydrous. Biotites from the two granites are Fe-rich and have high Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios (0.60\xe2\x80\x930.74). The magmatic temperatures estimated from zircon saturation thermometer are 802\xe2\x80\x93920 \xc2\xb0C for the two granites, higher than common I-type and S-type granites. The two granites show high contents of total alkalis (NaO + KO = 6.96\xe2\x80\x939.39 wt.%), high field strength elements (e.g. Zr = 181\xe2\x80\x93437 ppm, Y = 22.1\xe2\x80\x9339.7 ppm, Nb = 18.6\xe2\x80\x9330.3 ppm and Zr + Nb + Ce + Y = 324\xe2\x80\x93555 ppm), rare earth elements (total REE = 155\xe2\x80\x93312 ppm) as well as high Ga/Al ratios (10,000 \xc3\x97 Ga/Al = 2.50\xe2\x80\x933.44). These geochemical characteristics are similar to those of A-type granites. The Huitong and Epo granites have relatively low \xce\xb5(t) values of \xe2\x88\x92 10.4 to \xe2\x88\x92 7.7, and low zircon \xce\xb5(t) values (peak value of \xe2\x88\x92 8.0). Whole-rock two stage Nd isotopic model ages and zircon Hf isotopic model ages mostly vary from 1.78 Ga to 2.00 Ga. According to these data, we suggest that the two granites might have derived from partial melting of pre-Cambrian sedimentary rocks which had been granulitized during an earlier thermal event. The two granites contain abundant contemporaneous mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs). The MMEs display igneous textures and contain acicular apatites, suggesting quenching of mafic magmas that have co-mingled with the host granites. The MMEs might have derived from the enriched lithospheric mantle source.

Here we investigated the Hatu tholeiitic basalts and basaltic andesites of the western Junggar region, Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). LA-ICPMS zircon U\xe2\x80\x93Pb analyses indicate that the Hatu tholeiites were generated in the Late Carboniferous (~ 315 Ma). All the studied rock samples are characterized by flat rare earth elements pattern on chondrite-normalized plot, and negligible Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies on mid-ocean-ridge basalt normalized plots. They are also characterized by moderate positive \xce\xb5(t) (+ 5.25 to + 5.94), \xce\xb5(t) (+ 13.24 to + 14.89), highly radiogenic Os isotope compositions (Os/Os = 0.1338\xe2\x80\x930.3547), and relatively low (Sr/Sr) ratios (0.7044 to 0.7048). Taking into account their geological characteristics, the occurrence of nearby ophiolites and the types of contemporaneous magmatic rocks found in the western Junggar region, we propose that the Hatu basalts were generated by slab window-related processes following a spreading ridge subduction beneath the Keramay intra-oceanic island arc. During this process, deep and enriched asthenospheric mantle rose to the edge of the subducted oceanic lithosphere, its melts infiltrating the subducted oceanic lithosphere and reacting with peridotites. Therefore, the Hatu tholeiites are interpreted as a result of melting of a mixed mantle source consisting of subducted depleted oceanic lithosphere and a deep, enriched upwelling asthenospheric mantle. Incongruent dynamic melting modeling of trace element compositions indicates that the Hatu basalts could have been derived from large degrees of melting (~ 10%) of such a mixed mantle source.

Eruption of these rocks generally coincided with regional extension. New Sr, Nd, and whole-rock Pb isotopic data for Miocene rocks, from a transect from the western Mojave Desert to the Colorado River trough, provide clues to crustal and mantle structure during this important time period. Volcanism was calc-alkalic but transitional to alkalic in the eastern part of the area. Trace element contents, trace element ratios, and radiogenic isotopic compositions vary across the study area, and isotopic composition is correlated with both bulk chemical composition and longitude. Correlation of isotopic composition with bulk composition results from widespread contamination of mantle-derived basalts with crust. Variation of isotopic composition versus longitude for rocks of all bulk compositions reflects longitudinal variations in both mantle and crustal structure. Geochemical signatures of mafic rocks east of about long 116\xc2\xb0W indicate an ancient (Precambrian) enriched lithosphere source. Some thinned and/or reworked Precambrian crust extends west of 116\xc2\xb0W. Mafic rocks west of 116\xc2\xb0W were derived from mantle with oceanic geochemical and isotopic signatures. There is no clear, coincident, major crustal structure or tectonic boundary in surface geology at 116\xc2\xb0W; however, modern-day seismicity is restricted to areas west of this longitude, and there is a change in the dominant orientation of mountain ranges at this longitude. The data here also indicate that the long-standing problem of drawing the Sri = 0.706 line through the Mojave Desert can be resolved if the line represents the west edge of the North American mantle rather than Precambrian crust. By this definition, the Sri = 0.706 line would be the isotopic boundary at 116\xc2\xb0W. The cause of early Miocene volcanism in the Mojave Desert remains enigmatic.

In this study, the orthopyroxene- and plagioclase-rich and the garnet-rich and plagioclase-poor restitic granulite enclaves hosted by three peraluminous granitic plutons from South China were characterized. Mineral assemblages, mineral compositions, pressure-temperature pseudosection modeling, and zircon U-Pb data for the two types of restitic enclaves reveal that (1) an early (255\xe2\x80\x93249 Ma) melting event occurred at conditions of \xe2\x88\xbc950 \xc2\xb1 30 \xc2\xb0C and \xe2\x88\xbc500 \xc2\xb1 80 MPa, and (2) a later (245\xe2\x80\x93246 Ma) melting event occurred at conditions of \xe2\x88\xbc905 \xc2\xb1 15 \xc2\xb0C and \xe2\x88\xbc675 \xc2\xb1 25 MPa.

However, whilst a magmatic origin of the stratiform mineralization of the upper Platreef has been widely confirmed, the processes responsible for the PGE and BMS mineralization and metasomatism of the host rocks in the Platreef are still under discussion. In order to contribute to the present discussion, we present an integrated petrographical, mineral-chemical, whole-rock trace- and major-element, sulphur- and neodymium-isotope, study of Platreef footwall clinopyroxenite drill core samples from Overysel, which is located in the northern sector of the northern Bushveld limb. A metasomatic transformation of magmatic pyroxenite units to non-magmatic clinopyroxenite is in accordance with the petrography and whole-rock chemical analysis. The whole-rock data display lower SiO2, FeO, Na2O and Cr (&lt;1700 ppm), and higher CaO, concentrations in the here-studied footwall Platreef clinopyroxenite samples than primary magmatic Platreef pyroxenite and norite. The presence of capped globular sulphides in some samples, which display differentiation into pyrrhotite and pentlandite in the lower, and chalcopyrite in the upper part, is attributed to the fractional crystallization of a sulphide liquid, and a downward transport of the blebs. In situ sulphur (V-CDT) isotope BMS data show isotopic signatures (&delta;34S = 0.9 to 3.1 &permil;; &Delta;33S = 0.09 to 0.32&permil;) close to or within the pristine magmatic range. Elevated (non-zero) &Delta;33S values are common for Bushveld magmas, indicating contamination by older, presumably crustal sulphur in an early stage chamber, whereas magmatic &delta;34S values suggest the absence of local crustal contamination during emplacement. This is in accordance with the &epsilon;Nd (2.06 Ga) (chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR)) values, of &minus;6.16 to &minus;6.94, which are similar to those of the magmatic pyroxenite and norite of the Main Zone and the Platreef in the northern sector of the northern Bushveld limb. Base-metal sulphide textures and S&ndash;Se-ratios give evidence for a secondary S-loss during late- to post-magmatic hydrothermal alteration. The textural evidence, as well as the bulk S/Se ratios and sulphide S isotopes studies, suggest that the mineralization in both the less and the pervasively hydrothermally altered clinopyroxenite samples of Overysel are of magmatic origin. This is further supported by the PPGE (Rh, Pt, Pd) concentrations in the BMS and mass-balance calculations, in both of which large proportions of the whole-rock Pd and Rh are hosted by pentlandite, whereas Pt and the IPGE (Os, Ir, Ru) were interpreted to mainly occur in discrete PGM. However, the presence of pentlandite with variable PGE concentrations on the thin section scale may be related to variations in the S content, already at S-saturation during magmatic formation, and/or post-solidification mobilization and redistribution.",\n        "Minerals",\n        "10.3390/MIN10060570",\n        "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/6/570",\n        "2020-06-25"\n    ],\n    [\n        "springer_001f619dd722b1f1daf60dbc3ddc4a90310bd8c2",\n        "Interaction between crustal-derived felsic and mantle-derived mafic magmas in the Oberkirch Pluton (European Variscides, Schwarzwald, Germany)",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"Mineralogisches Institut, Universit\\\\u00e4t Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 236, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany e-mail: raltherr@classic.min.uni-heidelberg.de Tel.: +49-6221-548206; Fax: +49-6221-544805\\", \\"Bundesanstalt f\\\\u00fcr Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe, Stilleweg 2, D-30655 Hannover, Germany\\", \\"Mineralogisches Institut, Universit\\\\u00e4t Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 236, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany e-mail: raltherr@classic.min.uni-heidelberg.de Tel.: +49-6221-548206; Fax: +49-6221-544805\\", \\"Institut f\\\\u00fcr Mineralogie, Petrologie und Geochemie, Universit\\\\u00e4t Freiburg, Albertstrasse 23b, D-79104 Freiburg i.

The northern unit is relatively mafic (SiO2\xe2\x88\xbc64%) and lacks cordierite. The more felsic central and southern units (SiO2=67.8 to 70.4%) can only be distinguished from each other by the occurrence of cordierite in the former. Mafic microgranular enclaves of variable composition, texture and size occur in each of these units and are concentrated in their central domains. Most abundant are large (dm to m) hornblende-bearing enclaves with dioritic to tonalitic compositions (SiO2=50.8 to 56.3\xe2\x80\x89wt%; Mg#=63 to 41) and fine grained doleritic textures that suggest chilling against the host granite magma. Some of these enclaves are mantled by hybrid zones. Less common are microtonalitic enclaves containing biotite as the only primary mafic phase (SiO2=53.7 to 64.4%) and small hybrid tonalitic to granodioritic enclaves and schlieren. Synplutonic dioritic dikes (up to 6\xe2\x80\x89m thick) with hybrid transition zones to the host granite occur in the southern unit of the pluton. In chemical variation diagrams, samples from unmodified hornblende-bearing mafic enclaves and dikes form continuous trends that are compatible with an origin by fractionation of olivine, clinopyroxene, hornblende and plagioclase. Chemical and initial isotopic signatures (e.g. high Mg#, low Na2O, \xc9\x9bNd=\xe2\x88\x921.2 to \xe2\x88\x925.1, 87Sr/86Sr=0.7055 to 0.7080, \xce\xb418O=8.0 to 8.8\xe2\x80\xb0) exclude an origin by partial melting from a mafic meta-igneous source but favour derivation from a heterogeneous enriched lithospheric mantle. Samples from the granitic host rocks do not follow the chemical variation trends defined by the diorites but display large scatter. In addition, their initial isotopic characteristics (\xc9\x9bNd=\xe2\x88\x924.5 to \xe2\x88\x926.8, 87Sr/86Sr=0.7071 to 0.7115, \xce\xb418O=9.9 to 11.9\xe2\x80\xb0) show little overlap with those of the diorites. Most probably, the granitic magmas were derived from metapelitic sources characterized by variable amounts of garnet and plagioclase. This is suggested by relatively high molar ratios of Al2O3/(MgO+FeOtot) and K2O/Na2O, in combination with low ratios of CaO/(MgO+FeOtot), variable values of Sr/Nd, Eu/Eu*[=Eucn/(Smcn\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89Gdcn)0.5] and (Tb/Yb)cn (cn=chondrite-normalized) as well as variable abundances of Sc and Y. Whole-rock initial isotopic signatures of mafic microtonalitic enclaves (\xc9\x9bNd=\xe2\x88\x924.6 to \xe2\x88\x925.2; 87Sr/86Sr=0.7060 to 0.7073; \xce\xb418O \xe2\x88\xbc8.1\xe2\x80\xb0) are similar to those of the low \xc9\x9bNd diorites. Plagioclase concentrates from a granite sample and a mafic microtonalitic enclave are characterized by initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios that are significantly higher than those of their bulk rock systems suggesting incorporation of high 87Sr/86Sr crustal material into the magmas. Field relationships and petrographic evidence suggest that the Oberkirch pluton originated by at least three pulses of granitic magma containing mafic magma globules. In-situ hybridization between the different magmas was limited.

Geologic mapping reveals a pre-caldera (780\xe2\x80\x939.4 ka) and post-caldera (<9.4 ka) eruptive stage for South Pagan, whereas the eruptive history of the older CVR is poorly constrained. Crystal fractionation and magma mixing were important crustal processes for lavas from both volcanoes. Geochemical and isotopic variations indicate that South Pagan and CVR lavas, and lavas from the northern volcano on the island, Mt. Pagan, originated from compositionally distinct parental magmas due to variations in slab contributions (sediment and aqueous fluid) to the mantle wedge and the extent of mantle partial melting. A mixing model based on Pb and Nd isotopic ratios suggests that the average amount of sediment in the source of CVR (~2.1%) and South Pagan (~1.8%) lavas is slightly higher than Mt. Pagan (~1.4%) lavas. These estimates span the range of sediment-poor Guguan (~1.3%) and sediment-rich Agrigan (~2.0%) lavas for the Mariana arc. Melt modeling demonstrates that the saucer-shaped normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns observed in Pagan lavas can arise from partial melting of a mixed source of depleted mantle and enriched sediment, and do not require amphibole interaction or fractionation to depress the middle REE abundances of the lavas. The modeled degree of mantle partial melting for Agrigan (2\xe2\x80\x935%), Pagan (3\xe2\x80\x937%), and Guguan (9\xe2\x80\x9315%) lavas correlates with indicators of fluid addition (e.g., Ba/Th). This relationship suggests that the fluid flux to the mantle wedge is the dominant control on the extent of partial melting beneath Mariana arc volcanoes. A decrease in the amount of fluid addition (lower Ba/Th) and extent of melting (higher Sm/Yb), and an increase in the sediment contribution (higher Th/Nb, La/Sm, and Pb isotopic ratios) from Mt. Pagan to South Pagan could reflect systematic cross-arc or irregular along-arc melting variations.

Whole-rock samples define a Rb-Sr isochron age of 120\xc2\xb115 Ma and an initial 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.70391\xc2\xb14. \xc9\x9bNd values (at 120 Ma) show a relatively wide range of from \xe2\x88\x920.4 to 2.7 indicating decoupling of Sr-Nd isotope systems. Associated ultramafic rocks have initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios of from 0.70380 to 0.70430 and \xc9\x9bNd values of from 0.1 to 3.0. The different initial ratios suggest that the various intrusions, although contemporaneous, were not derived through fractionation of a single parent magma. A metasedimentary enclave incorporated during emplacement of the granulitic rocks preserves a Proterozoic isotopic signature with a measured \xc9\x9bNd(0) value of \xe2\x88\x9210.2, 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.73679 and a TNd provenance age of 1490 Ma. The Rb-Sr whole rock age of the granulites is the same as obtained from recent U-Pb zircon dating (Mattinson et al. 1986) and is interpreted as the time of magmatic emplacement and essentially contemporaneous granulite facies metamorphism. Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd analyses of mineral systems indicate that the terrain had cooled below \xe2\x88\xbc300\xc2\xb0 C by \xe2\x88\xbc100 Ma providing further evidence that high grade metamorphism was of exceptionally short duration.Unmetamorphosed leucogabbros from the Early Cretaceous Darran Complex of eastern Fiordland have significantly higher \xc9\x9bNd values (3.9 to 4.6) and slightly lower 87Sr/ 86Sr (0.70373 to 0.70386) than the western Fiordland granulites. This indicates that the western and eastern Fiordland complexes are not correlative although both have geochemical similarities to Phanerozoic calc-alkaline island-arc suites. The Fiordland granulites are LREE enriched (LaN/ YbN=12 to 40) and have trace element characteristics (e.g. high K/Rb and low Rb/Sr ratios) typical of many Rb-depleted Precambrian granulite terrains. The Fiordland trace element trends, however are attributed to magmatic, not metamorphic processes, reflecting the character of the Early Cretaceous magma sources. The range of \xc9\x9bNd values, but uniform initial 87Sr/86Sr of the western Fiordland granulites is consistent with derivation of the parent Early Cretaceous magmas at least in part from a LREE enriched, low Rb/Sr protoliths of mid-to late-Paleozoic age. Partial melting of this protolith occurred during or immediately preceding a period of great crustal thickening culminating in rapid thickening of existing crust by \xe2\x88\xbc20 km following emplacement of the granulitic rocks. The rapid crustal thickening was probably a consequence of a collisional event in which an Early Cretaceous magmatic arc was over-ridden by one or more thrust sheets.",\n        "Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology",\n        "10.1007/BF00371238",\n        "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00371238",\n        "1987-10-01"\n    ],\n    [\n        "springer_ce7733588084c36d738d941462464cf7e233fa0f",\n        "A trachyte\xe2\x80\x93syenite core within a basaltic nest: filtering of primitive injections by a multi-stage magma plumbing system (Oki-D\xc5\x8dzen, south-west Japan)",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"University of Tokyo$$$The University of Auckland\\", \\"University of Tokyo\\", \\"Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry\\", \\"Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry\\", \\"Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry\\", \\"University of Tokyo\\", \\"University of Tokyo\\"], \\"name\\": [\\"Marco Brenna\\", \\"Setsuya Nakada\\", \\"Daisuke Miura\\", \\"Kiyoshi Toshida\\", \\"Hisatoshi Ito\\", \\"Natsumi Hokanishi\\", \\"Shun\\\\u2019ichi Nakai\\"]}",\n        "Oki-D\xc5\x8dzen (Japan) is a Late Miocene (7\xe2\x80\x935 Ma) intraplate alkalic volcano composed of a central trachytic pyroclastic complex surrounded by a ring-shaped succession of basaltic to trachybasaltic lavas and pyroclastic rocks and dispersed trachytic bodies. The central trachytic complex is in contact with a syenite that was intruded into the basement early Miocene volcano-sedimentary succession. In the centre of the system there are no alkalic basaltic rocks that are correlative of the outer flank ring. We present whole-rock major and trace element chemistry, Sr\xe2\x80\x93Nd\xe2\x80\x93Pb isotopic compositions and petrological data from the central trachytic volcanic complex and the intrusive syenite body, as well as from the outer ring basaltic succession.

A younger (2.8 Ma) basaltic eruption (Uzuka basalt) has isotopic compositions that distinguish it from the rest of the system. Geochemical modelling indicates that magmatic differentiation through crystal fractionation and minor crustal assimilation occurred in crustal and shallow sub-volcanic magma reservoirs. In the central part of the system, a number of vertically spaced reservoirs acted as a filter, capturing basaltic dykes and hindering their ascent. In the outer region, dykes either reached the surface unhindered and erupted to form the basaltic/trachybasaltic succession or stalled at crustal levels and differentiated to trachyte before forming dispersed domes/flows. The central plumbing system \xe2\x80\x9cfilter\xe2\x80\x9d resulted in a nest-shaped volcano, with a trachytic core surrounded by basaltic products, and stopped direct injection of basaltic magmas into the shallow syenitic magma reservoir, likely preventing its destabilization and explosive eruption.",\n        "Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology",\n        "10.1007/S00410-015-1181-0",\n        "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00410-015-1181-0",\n        "2015-08-08"\n    ],\n    [\n        "wiley_23e958a16eb6cbb75240a1e354166d1385966dce",\n        "The nature of the crust in the Yukon\xe2\x80\x90Koyukuk Province as inferred from the chemical and isotopic composition of five Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary volcanic fields in western Alaska",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"\\", \\"\\"], \\"name\\": [\\"Elizabeth Moll\\\\u2010Stalcup\\", \\"J.

The chemical and isotopic composition of five of these Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary volcanic fields in the north central part of this province were studied to determine if Paleozoic or older continental crust underlies the Yukon\xe2\x80\x90Koyukuk province. Three of the fields, the Blackburn Hills, Yukon River, and Kanuti, occur within the Yukon\xe2\x80\x90Koyukuk province and two, the Sischu and Nowitna, overlie bordering Precambrian and Paleozoic metamorphic terranes to the southeast. High initial 87Sr/86Sr of 0.7075\xe2\x80\x930.7079 and moderate initial 143Nd/144Nd of 0.51244\xe2\x80\x930.51247 of rhyolite, dacite, and high\xe2\x80\x90silica andesite of the Sischu volcanic field indicate that the magmas have interacted with the underlying Paleozoic or older continental crust. The relatively limited variation of isotopic (initial 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7044\xe2\x80\x930.7051; initial 143Nd/144Nd = 0.51256\xe2\x80\x930.51257) and elemental compositions of andesites from the Nowitna field can be accounted for by assimilation of small amounts of Paleozoic or older continental crust during crystal fractionation of andesite parent magmas at crustal levels. The Blackburn Hills field, which consists of medium\xe2\x80\x90K basalt, andesite, and rhyolite intruded by a small granitic pluton, has a large range in initial 87Sr/86Sr and initial 143Nd/144Nd that plot in the field for 60 Ma mantle, from near mid\xe2\x80\x90ocean ridge basalts to near \xe2\x80\x9cbulk\xe2\x80\x90earth\xe2\x80\x9d compositions (initial 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7033\xe2\x80\x930.7052; initial 143Nd/144Nd = 0.51253\xe2\x80\x930.51290). Andesites and basalts from the Blackburn Hills are divided into two group on the basis of rare earth element (REE) and isotopic composition. Isotopic variation in the more primitive group 1 is best explained by assimilation of the lower crust of the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Koyukuk terrane by mantle\xe2\x80\x90derived basalts during crystal fractionation, though part of the isotopic variation may be due to metasomatism of an oceanic island basalt type mantle source by fluids derived from subducted sediments. Group 2 andesites from the Blackburn Hills have lower heavy REE abundances and more enriched isotopic compositions. These group 2 andesites and dacites from the Kanuti field, which have (87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7043\xe2\x80\x930.7048 and (143Nd/144Nd)i = 0.51248\xe2\x80\x930.51267, appear to have formed by partial melting of the lower crust of the Koyukuk terrane. The Yukon River field consists of basalt, andesite, dacite, and rhyolite having (87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7037\xe2\x80\x930.7051 and (143Nd/144Nd)i = 0.51266\xe2\x80\x930.51280; its isotopic composition does not require the presence of Paleozoic or older continental crust under the volcanic field and may have formed by interaction between mantle\xe2\x80\x90derived melts and the oceanic Angayucham/Tozitna or island arc Koyukuk terrane. Most of the intrusive rocks and rhyolite domes from the Blackburn Hills volcanic field have (87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7038\xe2\x80\x930.7041 and dacites from the Kanuti volcanic field have (87Sr/86Sr)i = 0.7043\xe2\x80\x930.7048. Thus little or no old continental crust was involved in the genesis of the Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary rocks and therefore probably does not extend beneath this part of the Yukon\xe2\x80\x90Koyukuk province. However, the ultimate source of the small volumes of enriched shoshonitic andesite (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7075, 143Nd/144Nd = 0.5125) erupted at 118 Ma in the Yukon\xe2\x80\x90Koyukuk province may be continental lithosphere, which may have been thrust under this part of the Yukon\xe2\x80\x90Koyukuk province during arc\xe2\x80\x90continent collision in the Early Cretaceous.",\n        "Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth",\n        "10.1029/JB094IB11P15989",\n        "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB094iB11p15989",\n        "1989-11-10"\n    ],\n    [\n        "wiley_65393b12db878a6ac711867a4f95d76110d40cb8",\n        "Comprehensive Pb\xe2\x80\x90Sr\xe2\x80\x90Nd\xe2\x80\x90Hf isotopic, trace element, and mineralogical characterization of mafic to ultramafic rock reference materials",\n        "{\\"affiliation\\": [\\"Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research, Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric SciencesUniversity of British ColumbiaVancouver British Columbia Canada\\", \\"Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research, Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric SciencesUniversity of British ColumbiaVancouver British Columbia Canada\\", \\"Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research, Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric SciencesUniversity of British ColumbiaVancouver British Columbia Canada\\"], \\"name\\": [\\"Ana\\\\u00efs Fourny\\", \\"Dominique Weis\\", \\"James S.
