      "abstract": "Oki-Dōzen (Japan) is a Late Miocene (7–5 Ma) intraplate alkalic volcano composed of a central trachytic pyroclastic complex surrounded by a ring-shaped succession of basaltic to trachybasaltic lavas and pyroclastic rocks and dispersed trachytic bodies. The central trachytic complex is in contact with a syenite that was intruded into the basement early Miocene volcano-sedimentary succession. In the centre of the system there are no alkalic basaltic rocks that are correlative of the outer flank ring. We present whole-rock major and trace element chemistry, Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic compositions and petrological data from the central trachytic volcanic complex and the intrusive syenite body, as well as from the outer ring basaltic succession. We also present and discuss a new set of zircon U/Pb ages collected from the central trachyte and syenite bodies. All the eruptive products of Oki-Dōzen, as well as the syenite, plot on a single liquid line of descent initiated from a mantle-derived alkalic basaltic parent. A younger (2.8 Ma) basaltic eruption (Uzuka basalt) has isotopic compositions that distinguish it from the rest of the system. Geochemical modelling indicates that magmatic differentiation through crystal fractionation and minor crustal assimilation occurred in crustal and shallow sub-volcanic magma reservoirs. In the central part of the system, a number of vertically spaced reservoirs acted as a filter, capturing basaltic dykes and hindering their ascent. In the outer region, dykes either reached the surface unhindered and erupted to form the basaltic/trachybasaltic succession or stalled at crustal levels and differentiated to trachyte before forming dispersed domes/flows. The central plumbing system “filter” resulted in a nest-shaped volcano, with a trachytic core surrounded by basaltic products, and stopped direct injection of basaltic magmas into the shallow syenitic magma reservoir, likely preventing its destabilization and explosive eruption.",

      "abstract": "The Eastern Pontides in NE Turkey is one of the major orogenic belts in Anatolia. In this paper, we report our new Ar/Ar dating, mineral chemistry, major and trace elements and Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic analyses of the lamprophyre intrusions in this region. The lamprophyres are widely scattered and intrude Late Carboniferous granitoid rocks. The lamprophyres exhibit fine-grained textures and are mineralogically uniform. Hornblende Ar/Ar dating yielded a plateau age of 216.01 ± 10.64 Ma. Based on their geochemistry, mineral compositions and paragenesis, the lamprophyres are classified as calc-alkaline lamprophyres in general and spessartites in particular, which are rich in large ion lithophile elements (e.g., Rb, Ba, K) but depleted in Nb and Ti. Our samples exhibit moderate fractionation in LREE patterns approximately 100 times that of chondrite but HREE abundances less than 10 times that of chondrite. These calc-alkaline lamprophyres display a range of I (216 Ma) values from 0.70619 to 0.71291 and ε (216 Ma) values from − 1.4 to 4.1, with = 1.11 to 2.20 Ga. Their Pb isotopic ratios indicate an enriched mantle source. The enrichment process is related to metasomatism of a subcontinental lithospheric mantle source, which is caused by a large quantity of HO-rich fluids, rather than sediments released from oceanic crust at depth during the closure of the Paleotethys Ocean in Triassic times. All of the geochemical data and the trace element modeling suggest that the primary magma of the calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline spessartites was generated at depth by a low degree of partial melting (~ 1–10%) of a previously enriched lithospheric mantle wedge consisting of phlogopite-bearing spinel peridotite. The ascendance of a hot asthenosphere triggered by extensional events caused partial melting of mantle material. The rising melts were accompanied by fractional crystallization and crustal contamination en route to the surface. All of the geochemical features combined with regional data suggest that the Eastern Pontides calc-alkaline lamprophyres originated in an extensional environment along an active continental margin throughout the Late Triassic. Such an extensional event, causing upwelling of hot asthenosphere, led to the opening of the northern branch of the Neotethys as a back-arc basin farther south of the Eastern Pontides.",

      "abstract": "Southwest (SW) China hosts more than 26 Mo (Mo-only, Mo-dominated and Mo-bearing) deposits with a total reserve of > 2.5 Mt Mo metal. The region has become one of the most important Mo mineral provinces in China. These Mo deposits are usually fault-controlled, and are located mainly in: (1) Lhasa Terrane, characterized by widely distributed Yanshanian–Himalayan igneous rocks; (2) Qiangtang Terrane, composed by Proterozoic and Early-Paleozoic crystalline basement and Devonian to Jurassic cover rocks; (3) East Kunlun Terrane, comprising Precambrian metamorphic rocks intruded by Paleozoic and Mesozoic granitoid plutons; (4) West Kunlun Terrane, characterized by Precambrian metamorphic basement, Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks, and Early-Paleozoic and Carboniferous–Triassic arc-type plutons; and (5) Yidun arc, composed by Middle and Upper Triassic volcanic–sedimentary successions. The Mo mineralization styles are dominated by porphyry-type, but also contain porphyry-skarn, skarn and porphyry-quartz vein types. Orebodies are vein-type or lensoidal, and are hosted by a variety of metamorphic, volcanic, granitic and sedimentary rocks of different ages. Fluid-rock interactions are exemplified by alteration zonation, which usually grades from an innermost potassic alteration zone, via a silicic/sericite alteration zone, to an outermost propylitic alteration zone. The initial high-temperature ore-forming fluids are magmatic in origin, and contain CO-bearing fluid inclusions. The initial ore-forming fluids would have then evolved to low-temperature, low-pressure, low-salinity and CO-poor (with meteoric water input) at the late alteration/mineralization stage. Causative granitoids for these Mo deposits have relatively high SiO, KO and AlO, and low TiO and MgO, showing a metaluminous to peraluminous high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic affinity. These granitoids exhibit significant depletions in Ba, Nb, Ta, P and Ti, and enrichments in Rb, Th, U and K. It is suggested that they were originated from partial melting of a lower rejuvenated crust, as evidenced by their Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic signatures. The Mo deposits in East and West Kunlun were formed in the Triassic (ca. 258–214 Ma), related to the Paleo-Tethys Ocean subduction and the subsequent continental collision. Major Mo mineralization in the Qiangtang and Lhasa terranes mainly occurred during the syn-collisional compression to post-collisional extension transition of the Qiangtang–Lhasa (ca. 43–35 Ma) and India–Asia (ca. 30–14 Ma) collisions, respectively. The Late-Cretaceous Mo mineralization (ca. 88–73 Ma) in the Yidun arc was formed during the late- or post- Lhasa–Qiangtang collision setting, or the intraplate extension led by the post-Himalayan escape tectonics. The wide range of molybdenite Re contents in these major SW Chinese Mo deposits indicates remarkable differences in metal, fluid sources and ages.",

They were sampled to characterize the effect of the Variscan orogeny onto the mantle beneath Lusatia. The tholeiitic gabbros originated from a mantle source that had been metasomatized during subduction beneath the Cadomian magmatic arc at c. 570 Ma, which led to enrichment of LREE, Ba/Nb, and LILE relative to primitive mantle. The late-Variscan calc-alkaline lamprophyres (spessartites) have high MgO, Cr, and Ni contents reflecting the mantle source. The spessartites, however, have distinctly higher Rb, Ba, Pb, Sr, Th, and Cs contents, higher La/Yb, Sr/Sr, and Pb/Pb ratios, and lower Nd/Nd ratios than the gabbros, which indicates a second, Variscan event of mantle enrichment. In addition, the spessartites have trace element ratios (i.e., Ba/Nb, Nb/U, Th/U, and Th/Nb) that resemble continental crust and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions that demonstrate involvement of crustal material by source enrichment during the Variscan orogeny. The calc-alkaline lamprophyres of the Lusatia occupy the same age range as calc-alkaline lamprophyres from the adjacent Erzgebirge and Sudetes. The trace-element signatures and Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of Lusatian spessartites, however, are less enriched than those of comparable dikes in the Sudetes and the Erzgebirge. This implies that the Variscan orogeny resulted in geochemically and isotopically heterogeneous lithospheric mantle on the regional scale, possibly reflecting the contrasting nature of the subducted rocks.► Ar–Ar hornblende age for calc-alkaline lamprophyres in Lusatia. ► Tholeiitic gabbro and lamprophyre from a repeatedly enriched mantle source. ► Regionally variably enriched mantle beneath the Variscan orogen.",

      "abstract": "The Cape Verde volcanic archipelago, located in the oceanic portion of the African plate some 500 km west of the Senegal coast, is renowned for the occurrence of carbonatites on at least 5 of its 10 islands. In this study we report the occurrence of about twenty new small outcrops of extrusive carbonatites on Brava Island (64 km), the south-westernmost island of the archipelago. These new occurrences are studied from geological, petrographic, mineral chemistry and whole rock (elemental and isotopic) geochemical points of view, allowing for a discussion of their petrogenesis and emphasising their geological and geochemical peculiarities in the context of the Cape Verde carbonatites.Most of the extrusive carbonatitic formations correspond to pyroclastic rocks, comprising magmatic and/or phreatomagmatic ash and lapilli fall deposits and one probable pyroclastic flow. Lava flows occur at one locality. The predominance of pyroclastic facies demonstrates the significant explosivity of these magmas characterised by very low viscosity. Independent of the modes of emplacement, all samples are calciocarbonatites and exhibit a remarkable compositional uniformity, considering that they represent several different eruptions and present a wide geographical dispersion.Brava extrusive carbonatites belong to the younger (probable Holocene – Pleistocene) volcanic sequence of the island. This feature is unique in the context of Cape Verde geology, because in the other islands (including Brava) of the archipelago carbonatites are commonly assigned to the basal complexes, having formed during a fairly early stage of the emerged evolution of volcanic construction.Compared with the older intrusive sövitic rocks occurring at Middle Unit of Brava Island, extrusive facies are more iron and manganese rich and yield higher contents of trace elements like Ba, Th, U, Nb, Pb and REE, but somewhat lower Sr abundances. New initial Sr and Nd isotope data (0.703557–0.703595 and 0.512792–0.512816, respectively) determined in extrusive calciocarbonatitic rocks are clearly different from those obtained in intrusive rocks (0.703340–0.703356 and 0.512910–0.512912, respectively), which demonstrates that the studied rocks were ultimately the product of a source distinct from those that produced the older intrusive carbonatites. Brava extrusive carbonatites yield isotope signatures that are clearly distinct from all other Cape Verde carbonatites, but akin to the Southern Cape Verde silicate rocks. We propose that the extrusive carbonatites resulted from an immiscibility process that also produced conjugate melts of nephelinitic composition.",

      "abstract": "The Middle Urals are characterized by a major virgation in the linear trend of the Urals orogen, and represent the most highly contracted part of the late Palaeozoic collisional belt. This part of the orogen is dominated by metamorphic complexes and major fault and shear zones. The Main Uralian Fault zone (MUF), the east-dipping suture of the orogen containing low-grade metamorphic rocks, separates the Sysert Complex in the east from the Ufaley Complex in the west. The Sysert Complex in the hanging wall of the MUF consists of intensely deformed gneisses, granitic intrusions and a metamorphosed mélange zone. Tectonic and isotopic investigations suggest the following stages for the evolution of the Sysert Complex: (a) pre-orogenic rifting and magmatism during Ordovician and Silurian times; (b) oceanic closure, island arc formation related to convergence and subduction during Devonian times; (c) major ductile deformation under amphibolite facies conditions related to NW-directed thrusting associated with crustal stacking during collision in Carboniferous times; (d) exhumation and contractional intracontinental tectonics during Permian times; and (e) closing of isotope systems related to cooling and the end of orogenic shortening through Triassic times. The Ufaley Complex, in the footwall of the MUF, is interpreted as an east-dipping crustal stack that records an amphibolite facies Uralian metamorphism. Lithologically the complex can be divided into pre-orogenic European basement (West Ufaley) and intensely deformed Palaeozoic metasediments and amphibolites (East Ufaley). High-pressure relics in the East Ufaley Complex are interpreted to be the result of subduction, whereas intense ductile deformation is related to overthrusting onto West Ufaley. The West Ufaley Complex is composed of gneisses, amphibolites, migmatites and granitic intrusions and has been thrust onto Devonian limestones along a major shear zone. In both Sysert and Ufaley Complexes, NW-trending stretching lineations and top-to-the-NW kinematic indicators suggest an oblique plate convergence with a significant sinistral component. The MUF is interpreted as a major normal fault that developed congruent with continental subduction and that compensated lithospheric thickening and the rapid exhumation of subducted crust in the footwall.",

The Vestfold sequence consists of subalkaline to alkaline basalts, potassic trachybasalts and shoshonites. At Krokskogen B is a subalkaline basalt. The Vestfold basaltic lavas show a relatively wide range in trace element concentrations, and Ta-enriched trace element abundance patterns. Ratios between pairs of incompatible elements show small, but significant variations e.g., Th/Ta: 1.2-1.8. The highest Th/Ta (2.1) is found in the Krokskogen basalt. A Th/Ta of 1.2 is typical of MORB and OIB, whereas the ratio 1.8 is typical of the lower crust. This variation in Th/Ta is not linked to trace element concentrations, but is accompanied by a regular shift in age-corrected , and from + 4.1, −10 and +19.2 to −1, +18 and +17.7, respectively.The observed variations in incompatible element ratios, initial isotopic ratios and trace element concentrations are interpreted as follows: The basaltic magmas which gave rise to the Vestfold and Krokskogen lavas originated in lithospheric mantle, which was mildly depleted with respect to Nd-Sr isotopic ratios but relatively rich in radiogenic Pb (PREMA-type). These magmas were retained in the lower crust where they crystallized ol + cpx; some of the magmas were also contaminated. The highest degree of contamination is seen in the lower part of the Vestfold sequence and in the Krokskogen basalt. At the present level of information about the Oslo Rift (no data are available for its southern, submerged part), rift magmatism appears to be dominated by a PREMA source in the pre-rift lower lithosphere. The dominance of a lithospheric mantle source in the rift magmatism suggests that the Oslo rifting event was initiated by passive mechanisms.",

To the north and south this peak is flanked by ∼ 300 km long, isotopically homogeneous sections of ridge with higher (∼ +10.9) and lower (∼ 0.7024) and (∼ 18.1). Although otherwise similar, these two sections differ from each other slightly in their and ratios. The isotopic peak corresponds to a region of greater axial cross-sectional area, but axial bathymetry and physical segmentation appear generally unrelated to mantle isotopic composition. However, an abrupt break in isotopic ratios does occur at the large, > 3 Ma, southward-propagating overlapping spreading center at 20.7°S, which marks the end of the south limb or flank of the isotopic peak. The peak itself appears to be a manifestation of large-scale binary mixing between material possessing at least mildly plume-like Nd, Pb, and Sr isotopic characteristics (most abundant at ∼ 17–17.5°S) and two slightly different high- mantle end-members equivalent to those north of 15.8°S and south of 20.7°S. Helium isotopes also define a prominent along-axis peak, but it spans a much narrower range of latitude and is offset slightly to the north of those for Nd, Sr and Pb isotopes. The combined results suggest that a discrete mantle heterogeneity may be entering into the melt zone near 15.8°S and migrating southward as far as the 20.7°S overlapping spreading center.Isotopic variability at short length scales is very limited throughout the entire 13–23°S region. It cannot be solely a result of homogenization by petrogenetic processes, because there is a lack of corresponding uniformity in ratios of highly to moderately incompatible elements; also, isotopes do not correlate with major element indicators of degree of partial melting or differentiation, or, in general, with the secondary magmatic segmentation thought to reflect different partial melting domains. Therefore, the subaxial mantle must be isotopically well-mixed relative to the scale of melting. In part, this probably reflects: (1) a larger of melting per unit length of ridge; and (2) a greater flow of mantle into the subaxial melt zone at super-fast spreading; but also must represent (3) a reduced amount of real isotopic variability in the shallow asthenosphere, as emphasized by the regional isotopic uniformity north and south of the isotopic peak. Such large-scale homogeneity could be a result of enhanced convective asthenospheric mixing over a long period of time. It could also reflect a low, long-term input of continental, lithospheric, recycled slab, or plume-type material into the regional asthenosphere.Largely independent of the north-south isotopic patterns is a fairly regular, southward depletion in highly incompatible elements such as Rb and Nb, superimposed on which is sizable local variability. Because ratios of highly to moderately incompatible elements show little or no correlation with major-element indicators of degree of melting, much of the variation in highly incompatible elements must be caused by a different (probably larger) volume of mantle than that conferring the major element signatures, or by one (or more) event that preceded the main melting episode in the not too ancient past.",

      "abstract": "Strontium and carbon isotopes of marine carbonates are routinely applied for chemostratigraphic cross correlations of time-equivalent sedimentary sequences and for calibration of the compositional evolution of seawater throughout Earths history, mainly for the purpose of reconstructing ancient climatic changes. We here present results of a new isotopic tracer system – stable chromium isotopes – applied to a late Ediacaran marine carbonate sequence exposed in the Calera de Recalde syncline, Arroyo del Soldado Group, Uruguay. The aim was to compare Cr isotope signatures directly to δC, Sr/Sr and Nd/Nd fluctuations in a well defined stratigraphic profile comprising sediments that were deposited during cold–warm periods accompanied by sea-level changes in response to glaciation–deglaciation at higher latitudes. The studied section is characterized by a pronounced negative (down to − 3.3‰) δC excursion in carbonates paralleled by a decrease of Sr/Sr values. Chromium isotope signatures over this section also show a correlated decrease in δCr (δCr = [((Cr/Cr) / (Cr/Cr)) − 1] × 1000) values from ~+0.29 to − 0.17‰ which mirrors a decrease in positively fractioned seawater signatures to slightly negative values characteristic of high-temperature magmatic sources. Linear correlations between δCr and εNd(570 Ma), Sr/Sr and Cr concentrations can be explained by mixing between two major input sources of Cr, Nd and Sr into the shallow seawater: 1) a source characterized by negative δCr values of ~−0.2‰ , low Sr/Sr values of ~ 0.707, and elevated Sm/Nd values of ~ 0.13, recognized as a subaqueous hydrothermal dominated input source, and 2) a source characterized by positively fractionated δCr values of ~+0.2‰, higher Sr/Sr values of ~ 0.708, and lower Sm/Nd values of ~ 0.11, a source which is strongly affected by continentally derived input. Chromium isotopes provide a powerful tool for reconstructing the redox state of ancient seawater since positive values indicate that, at least locally, Neoproterozoic shallow ocean waters were sufficiently oxidized to fractionate chromium and/or that oxygen levels of the atmosphere were sufficient to transform Cr(III) into the more mobile hexavalent Cr(VI) formed during weathering processes on land.The fact that Sr/Sr values, despite δC fluctuations, remain low (indicative of a strong hydrothermal input into the basin at his time) implies that CO limitation was the cause of negative δC and δCr excursions in otherwise nutrient rich late Neoproterozoic basins, and that glaciation is only one more consequence of a tectonically driven, biologically mediated system. In such a scenario, glaciation acts as an amplifier of δCr signals. These signals in marine carbonates are a sensitive tracer for redox processes in the ocean and/or on land and have the potential to contribute significantly, in combination with the other commonly used isotopic tracers, to the reconstruction of climatic changes, particularly those that are associated with major glaciation periods in Earth's history.► Systematic Cr isotope record over a Late Ediacaran negative δC excursion. ► Covariations between Sr, Nd and Cr isotopes imply a two source mixing. ► Mirroring of the δC excursion by δCr reflects changes in bioproductivity. ► Cr isotopes in marine carbonates potentially monitor atmospheric fluctuations.",

The complex comprises a two-phase rapakivi granite batholith with subordinate quartz–fayalite monzonites and syenites and the closely associated Repartimento anorthosite. Zircon U–Pb (ID–TIMS) geochronology reveals that the anorthosite (1526 ± 2 Ma), monzonite (1526 ± 2 Ma), and the main-phase biotite–hornblende granite (1527 ± 2 Ma) of the complex intruded the Paleoproterozoic (~ 1.94 Ga) country rocks simultaneously at ~ 1526 Ma and that the more evolved biotite granite is marginally younger at 1519 ± 2 Ma. Intraplate magmatism in the Mucajaí region was relatively short-lived and lasted 12 million years (1529–1517 Ma) at maximum.

The small isotopic differences observed in the two types of rapakivi granites (biotite–hornblende granite and biotite granite) may result either from an isotopically heterogeneous lower crustal source or, more likely, from contamination of the granitic magma derived from a lower crustal source during prolonged residence at upper crustal levels.► Petrogenesis of the 1525 Ma Mucajaí complex in Brazil was studied. ► U–Pb, Sm–Nd, Lu–Hf, and O isotopic and geochemical methods were utilized. ► Rapakivi granite and anorthositic magmatism lasted at most 12 million years. ► Late magmatic shift in isotope compositions of coeval granites was observed.",

      "abstract": "Pristine samples from the lunar highlands potentially offer important information bearing on the nature of early crustal development on all the terrestrial planets. One apparently unique sample of this group of lunar crustal rocks, the feldspathic lherzolite 67667, was studied utilizing the Sm-Nd radiometric system in an attempt to define its age and the implications of that age for the evolution of the lunar highlands. Data for 67667 precisely define an isochron corresponding to an age of 4.18±0.07 AE. The observed lack of disturbance of the Sm-Nd system of this sample may suggest that this time marks its crystallization at shallow depth in the lunar crust. However, the possibility that this age, as well as those of other highland rocks, indicate the time of their impact-induced excavation from regions deep enough in the lunar crust to allow subsolidus isotopic equilibrium to be produced or maintained between their constituent minerals is also considered. Taken together, bulk rock Sm-Nd data for four “high-Mg” rocks, including 67667, indicate that the chemical characteristics of all their source materials were established 4.33±0.08 AE ago and were intimately associated with the parent materials of KREEP. This finding provides more support for the concept of a large-scale differentiation episode early in lunar history. The possible roles of the crystallization of a global magma ocean, endogenous igneous activity, and of planetesimal impact, in producing the observed geochemical and chronological aspects of lunar highland rocks are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The Karacadağ (Kulu-Konya) area is one of the main volcanic provinces in Central Anatolia. The Karacadağ volcanites are composed of large volumes of andesitic-dacitic lavas associated with pyroclastics and small volumes of alkali basalt, trachybasalt and trachyandesite lavas. Two groups of volcanic rocks can be distinguished: (1) calcalkaline rocks including andesites and dacites, and (2) alkaline rocks including basalts, trachybasalts and trachyandesites. Ar/Ar ages show that the Karacadağ volcanites were erupted during Early Miocene (ca.18–19 Ma) and suggest that alkaline volcanites succeed shortly afterwards calcalkaline volcanites. Major oxides and trace elements plotted versus SiO suggest fractionation of hornblende, Fe–Ti oxide and apatite for calcalkaline volcanic rocks and olivine, clinopyroxene and Fe–Ti oxide for alkaline volcanic rocks in the magmatic evolution. The incompatible trace element patterns of the calcalkaline volcanites show enrichment of LILEs (Sr, K, Rb, Ba and Th) and negative HFSEs (Nb, Ta) anomalies suggesting an enriched lithospheric source by a subduction-related process. On the other hand, alkaline volcanites show enrichment of both LILEs and HFSEs suggesting an enriched lithospheric source by small volume melts from the asthenosphere. The rocks also have moderately fractionated REE patterns with (La/Lu) ratios of 7–24 for calcalkaline and 6–17 for alkaline volcanites. Moreover, the volcanites have relatively low Sr/Sr(t) ratios for between 0.703782 and 0.705129, and high () values between +2.25 and +4.49. Generally, the Sr–Nd isotopic compositions of the rocks range from the mantle array to bulk earth. All of these observations and findings suggest that the calcalkaline volcanites were formed in a subduction modified orogenic setting, and the alkaline volcanites in a within-plate setting.",

The Kovdor PCC is a part of the Kovdor ultramafic–alkaline–carbonatite massif, and consists of six intrusions. The initial isotopic ratios of the analyzed samples, calculated at 380 Ma, display limited variations: , + 2.0 to + 4.7; Sr/Sr, 0.70319 to 0.70361 (, − 12.2 to − 6.2); Pb/Pb, 18.38 to 18.74; Pb/Pb, 15.45 to 15.50; Pb/Pb, 37.98 to 39.28. The Nd and Sr isotope data of the Kovdor PCC generally fit the patterns of the other phoscorites and carbonatites from the Kola Alkaline Province (KAP), but some data are slightly shifted from the mixing line defined as the Kola Carbonatite Line, having more radiogenic Sr/Sr ratios. However, the less radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions and negative Δ7/4 values of Pb isotopes of the analyzed samples exclude crustal contamination, but imply the involvement of a metasomatized lithospheric mantle source. Isotopic variations indicate mixing of at least three distinct mantle components: FOZO-like primitive plume component, EMI-like enriched component and DMM-like depleted component. The isotopic nature of the EMI- and DMM-like mantle component observed in the Kovdor samples is considered to be inherited from metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle.

The relatively high SiO and HREE contents and low Nb/Ta ratios as well as strongly negative Eu and Sr anomalies of some of the rocks from the Dadian complex suggest that crustal material was also involved in the formation of this complex and that the crustal component was probably derived through partial melting at low pressure.

      "abstract": "The processes of magma generation in upwelling eclogite bodies of recycled lithospheric material are not fully understood but are important for our understanding and modelling of major and trace element variations in many ocean island basalts (OIB). The primitive alkaline intraplate basalts from the Payenia volcanic province (34–38 °S) in Argentina, for which Sr, Nd and double-spike Pb isotope ratios are presented, and from other north Patagonian volcanic fields may provide details of the eclogite melt–peridotite reactions taking place in the melting column of an upwelling OIB-type mantle. The isotopic composition of the uncontaminated lavas is highly restricted but the Payenia basalts fall in two distinct trace element groups termed the high and low Nb/U groups, which both have EM1-type trace element patterns but with subtle differences that cannot be explained by contamination, fractionation or simple variations in degrees of mantle melting. The difference is also clear in major elements where the low Nb/U basalts have markedly higher alkali contents but lower FeO and Ni than the high Nb/U basalts. Four melt components have been identified based on olivine fractionation corrected compositions: a low Nb/U pyroxenite melt component which is interpreted as an eclogite melt that experienced low degrees of melt–peridotite interaction, a high Nb/U pyroxenite melt component which is interpreted as an eclogite melt that experienced high degrees of melt–peridotite interaction, a low pressure peridotite melt component which contributes to most high Nb/U, Payún Matrú, Matancilla and Auca Mahuida basalts and finally, a melt component with similarities to peridotite melts contributing to many low Nb/U lavas. The high Nb/U type basalts are interpreted to have been formed from mantle with higher temperature than ambient mantle while the low Nb/U basalts may have been formed from normal temperature mantle.",

Alkaline lamprophyres can be generated by 10% partial melting of a metasomatically enriched garnet peridotite.

      "abstract": "Whole-rock isotope ratio (Hf, Nd, Pb, Sr) and trace element data for basement rocks at ocean drilling Sites U1438, 1201 and 447 immediately west of the KPR (Kyushu-Palau Ridge) are compared to those of FAB (forearc basalts) previously interpreted to be the initial products of IBM subduction volcanism. West-of-KPR basement basalts (drill sites U1438, 1201, 447) and FAB occupy the same Hf-Nd and Pb-Pb isotopic space and share distinctive source characteristics with ε mostly\\u202f>\\u202f16.5 and up to ε\\u202f=\\u202f19.8, which is more radiogenic than most Indian mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB). Lead isotopic ratios are depleted, with Pb/Pb\\u202f=\\u202f17.8–18.8 accompanying relatively high Pb/Pb, indicating an Indian-MORB source unlike that of West Philippine Basin plume basalts. Some Sr isotopes show affects of seawater alteration, but samples with Sr/Sr\\u202f<\\u202f0.7034 and ε\\u202f>\\u202f8.0 appear to preserve magmatic compositions and also indicate a common source for west-of-KPR basement and FAB. Trace element ratios resistant to seawater alteration (La/Yb, Lu/Hf, Zr/Nb, Sm/Nd) in west-of-KPR basement are generally more depleted than normal MORB and so also appear similar to FAB. At Site U1438, only andesite sills intruding sedimentary rocks overlying the basement have subduction-influenced geochemical characteristics (ε\\u202f∼\\u202f6.6, ε\\u202f∼\\u202f13.8, La/Yb\\u202f>\\u202f2.5, Nd/Hf\\u202f∼\\u202f9). The key characteristic that unites drill site basement rocks west of KPR and FAB is the nature of their source, which is more depleted in lithophile trace elements than average MORB but with Hf, Nd, and Pb isotope ratios that are common in MORB. The lithophile element-depleted nature of FAB has been linked to initiation of IBM subduction in the Eocene, but Sm-Nd model ages and errorchron relationships in Site U1438 basement indicate that the depleted character of the rocks is a regional characteristic that was produced well prior to the time of subduction initiation and persists today in the source of modern IBM arc volcanic rocks with Sm/Nd\\u202f>\\u202f0.34 and ε\\u202f∼\\u202f9.0.",

      "abstract": "New U–Pb ages and Sr–Nd–Hf isotopic data on mineral phases of the Sung Valley and Jasra ultramafic-alkaline-(carbonatite) intrusions (Shillong Plateau, India) shed new light on the petrogenetic processes of volcanism in north-eastern India during the Cretaceous. Perovskites of Sung Valley dunite, ijolite and uncompahgrite yielded U–Pb ages of 109.1\\u202f±\\u202f1.6, 104.0\\u202f±\\u202f1.3 and 101.7\\u202f±\\u202f3.6\\u202fMa, respectively. A U–Pb age of 106.8\\u202f±\\u202f1.5\\u202fMa was obtained on zircons of a Sung Valley nepheline syenite. Perovskite of a Jasra clinopyroxenite yielded an age of 101.6\\u202f±\\u202f1.2\\u202fMa, different from the U–Pb age of 106.8\\u202f±\\u202f0.8\\u202fMa on zircon of Jasra syenites. The variation in Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions [initial Sr/Sr\\u202f=\\u202f0.70472 to 0.71080; ε\\u202f=\\u202f−10.85 to +0.86; ε\\u202f=\\u202f−7.43 to +1.52] matches the bulk-rock isotopic composition of the different rock units of Sung Valley and Jasra. Calcite and apatite in the carbonatites, the perovskite in a dunite, and the bulk-rock carbonatites of Sung Valley intrusion have the lowest initial Sr/Sr and ε, taken to be the best proxies of the mantle source composition, which is dominated by components derived from the lithospheric mantle. The alkaline intrusions of north-eastern India are significantly younger than the Sylhet tholeiitic magmatism. The silicate rocks of both intrusions have isotopic composition trending to that of the underlying Shillong crust, indicating the effects of fractional crystallization and low-pressure crustal contamination during the emplacement of the various intrusive magma pulses.",
