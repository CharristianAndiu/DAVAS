        "abstract": "We discuss a less known aspect of Feynman's multifaceted scientific work,\ncentered about his interest in molecular biology, which came out around 1959\nand lasted for several years. After a quick historical reconstruction about the\nbirth of molecular biology, we focus on Feynman's work on genetics with Robert\nS. Edgar in the laboratory of Max Delbruck, which was later quoted by Francis\nCrick and others in relevant papers, as well as in Feynman's lectures given at\nthe Hughes Aircraft Company on biology, organic chemistry and microbiology,\nwhose notes taken by the attendee John Neer are available. An intriguing\nperspective comes out about one of the most interesting scientists of the XX\ncentury.",

        "abstract": "Quantifying the adaptive landscape in a given dynamical processes has been\none of most important goals in theoretical biology. It can have immediate\nimplications for many dynamical properties, such as robustness and plasticity.\nBased on recent work here I give a nontechnical brief review of this powerful\nquantitative concept in biology. This concept was initially proposed by S\nWright 70 years ago, re-introduced by one of the founders of molecular biology\nand by others in different biological contexts. It was apparently forgotten by\nmainstream modern biologists for many years. Currently, this concept has found\nits increasingly important role in the development of systems biology and the\nmodeling of bionetwork dynamics, from phage lambda genetic switch to endogenous\nnetwork of cancer genesis and progression. It is an ideal quantify to describe\nthe robustness and stability of bionetworks. I will first introduce five\nlandmark proposals in biology on this concept, to demonstrate the important\ncommon thread in its theoretical biology development. Then I will discuss a few\nrecent results, focusing on the work showing the logical consistency of\nadaptive landscape. From the perspective of a working scientist and of what\nneeded for a dynamical theory when confronting empirical data, the adaptive\nlandscape is useful both metaphorically and quantitatively and has captured an\nessential aspect of biological dynamical processes. Still, many important open\nproblems remain to be solved. Having this important problem under control, we\nmay expect that we are on the right road to quantitatively formulate the\nevolutionary dynamics discovered by Darwin and Wallace.",

        "abstract": "Embryogenesis, the process by which an organism forms and develops, has long\nbeen and still is a major field of investigation in the natural sciences. By\nwhich means, which forces, are embryonic cells and tissues assembled, deformed,\nand eventually organized into an animal? Because embryogenesis deeply questions\nour understanding of the mechanisms of life, it has motivated many scientific\ntheories and philosophies over the course of history. While genetics now seems\nto have emerged as a natural background to study embryogenesis, it was intuited\nlong ago that it should also rely on mechanical forces and on the physical\nproperties of cells and tissues. In the early 20th century, Stephane Leduc\nproposed that biology was merely a subset of fluid physics, and argued that\nbiology should focus on how forces act on living matter. Rejecting vitalism and\nlife-specific approaches, he designed naive experiments based on osmosis and\ndiffusion to mimic shapes and phenomena found in living systems, in order to\nidentify physical mechanisms that could support the development of the embryo.\nWhile Leduc's ideas then had some impact in the field, notably on later\nacclaimed D'Arcy Thompson, they fell into oblivion during the later 20th\ncentury. In this article I give an overview of Stephane Leduc's physical\napproach to life, and show that the paradigm that he introduced, although long\nforsaken, becomes more and more topical today, as developmental biology\nincreasingly turns to physics and self-organization theories to study the\nmechanisms of embryogenesis. His story, I suggest, bears witness to our\nreluctance to abandon life-specific approaches in biology.",

        "Published: ": "2016-07-21T15:10:57Z",
        "abstract": "Background: Many mathematical models have now been employed across every area\nof systems biology. These models increasingly involve large numbers of unknown\nparameters, have complex structure which can result in substantial evaluation\ntime relative to the needs of the analysis, and need to be compared to observed\ndata. The correct analysis of such models usually requires a global parameter\nsearch, over a high dimensional parameter space, that incorporates and respects\nthe most important sources of uncertainty. This can be an extremely difficult\ntask, but it is essential for any meaningful inference or prediction to be made\nabout any biological system. It hence represents a fundamental challenge for\nthe whole of systems biology.\n  Results: Bayesian statistical methodology for the uncertainty analysis of\ncomplex models is introduced, which is designed to address the high dimensional\nglobal parameter search problem. Bayesian emulators that mimic the systems\nbiology model but which are extremely fast to evaluate are embedded within an\niterative history match: an efficient method to search high dimensional spaces\nwithin a more formal statistical setting, while incorporating major sources of\nuncertainty. The approach is demonstrated via application to two models of\nhormonal crosstalk in Arabidopsis root development, which have 32 rate\nparameters, for which we identify the sets of rate parameter values that lead\nto acceptable matches to observed trend data. The biological consequences of\nthe resulting comparison, including the evaluation of gene functions, are\ndescribed.",

In the present\ntheoretical article, we propose that efforts to bridge the teaching of these\ntwo disciplines must emphasize shared scientific practices, particularly\nscientific modeling. We define modeling using language common to both\ndisciplines and highlight how an understanding of the modeling process can help\nreconcile apparent differences between the teaching of physics and biology. We\nelaborate how models can be used for explanatory, predictive, and functional\npurposes and present common models from each discipline demonstrating key\nmodeling principles.
