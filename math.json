        "abstract": "Math anxiety negatively relates to math performance. This negative\nrelationship may be exacerbated in low-progress math learners. However, there\nare limited studies on math anxiety among low progress learners in a\nparadoxically high performing education system like Singapore. To fill this\nresearch gap, this research analysed the anxiety profiles of 151 students who\nwere in the math learning support intervention program administered by the\nMinistry of Education, Singapore (MOE). We examined the complex relationship\ncentred in math anxiety with relevant variables such as demographic\ncharacteristics, working memory and math performance. Limitations and future\ndirections are discussed.",

        "Published: ": "2019-11-27T20:37:26Z",
        "abstract": "Mathematical equations are an important part of dissemination and\ncommunication of scientific information. Students, however, often feel\nchallenged in reading and understanding math content and equations. With the\ndevelopment of the Web, students are posting their math questions online.\nNevertheless, constructing a concise math headline that gives a good\ndescription of the posted detailed math question is nontrivial. In this study,\nwe explore a novel summarization task denoted as geNerating A concise Math\nhEadline from a detailed math question (NAME). Compared to conventional\nsummarization tasks, this task has two extra and essential constraints: 1)\nDetailed math questions consist of text and math equations which require a\nunified framework to jointly model textual and mathematical information; 2)\nUnlike text, math equations contain semantic and structural features, and both\nof them should be captured together. To address these issues, we propose\nMathSum, a novel summarization model which utilizes a pointer mechanism\ncombined with a multi-head attention mechanism for mathematical representation\naugmentation. The pointer mechanism can either copy textual tokens or math\ntokens from source questions in order to generate math headlines. The\nmulti-head attention mechanism is designed to enrich the representation of math\nequations by modeling and integrating both its semantic and structural\nfeatures. For evaluation, we collect and make available two sets of real-world\ndetailed math questions along with human-written math headlines, namely\nEXEQ-300k and OFEQ-10k. Experimental results demonstrate that our model\n(MathSum) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models for both the\nEXEQ-300k and OFEQ-10k datasets.",

        "abstract": "Mathematical questioning is crucial for assessing students problem-solving\nskills. Since manually creating such questions requires substantial effort,\nautomatic methods have been explored. Existing state-of-the-art models rely on\nfine-tuning strategies and struggle to generate questions that heavily involve\nmultiple steps of logical and arithmetic reasoning. Meanwhile, large language\nmodels(LLMs) such as ChatGPT have excelled in many NLP tasks involving logical\nand arithmetic reasoning. Nonetheless, their applications in generating\neducational questions are underutilized, especially in the field of\nmathematics. To bridge this gap, we take the first step to conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of ChatGPT in generating pre-university math questions. Our analysis\nis categorized into two main settings: context-aware and context-unaware. In\nthe context-aware setting, we evaluate ChatGPT on existing math\nquestion-answering benchmarks covering elementary, secondary, and ternary\nclasses. In the context-unaware setting, we evaluate ChatGPT in generating math\nquestions for each lesson from pre-university math curriculums that we crawl.\nOur crawling results in TopicMath, a comprehensive and novel collection of\npre-university math curriculums collected from 121 math topics and 428 lessons\nfrom elementary, secondary, and tertiary classes.

        "abstract": "For the incompressible Euler equations the pressure formally scales as a\nquadratic function of velocity. We provide several optimal regularity estimates\non the pressure by using regularity of velocity in various Sobolev, Besov and\nHardy spaces. Our proof exploits the incompressibility condition in an\nessential way and is deeply connected with the classic Div-Curl lemma which we\nalso generalise as a fractional Leibniz rule in Hardy spaces. To showcase the\nsharpness of results, we construct a class of counterexamples at several\nend-points.",

Adopting the ICT in math courses are still in the\ninfant level. Hence its a challenge placed in front of the IT and academic\nprofessionals teaching math to make a suitable ICT tools for math courses to\nmake the learning an amusing experience. In this paper we have highlighted\nthree main concepts which make the math classes in a fascinating way. The first\nmethod is introducing revolutionary hybrid ebooks which make the reading with\nboth audio and video facilities. The second method is facilitating the flip\nclass room so that student may have anywhere-anytime learning experience.\nFinally the recent trends in m-learning are using apps for math courses. We\nhave highlighted the improvement showed by the students based on the survey\nconducted with two groups of students with m-learning tools and without\nm-learning tools. Even though there are good improvements showed by the\nstudents, we the researchers feel that few more improvements are required in\nthese methodologies.

        "Published: ": "2018-11-02T03:04:21Z",
        "abstract": "Solving math word problems is a challenging task that requires accurate\nnatural language understanding to bridge natural language texts and math\nexpressions. Motivated by the intuition about how human generates the equations\ngiven the problem texts, this paper presents a neural approach to automatically\nsolve math word problems by operating symbols according to their semantic\nmeanings in texts. This paper views the process of generating equation as a\nbridge between the semantic world and the symbolic world, where the proposed\nneural math solver is based on an encoder-decoder framework. In the proposed\nmodel, the encoder is designed to understand the semantics of problems, and the\ndecoder focuses on tracking semantic meanings of the generated symbols and then\ndeciding which symbol to generate next. The preliminary experiments are\nconducted in a dataset Math23K, and our model significantly outperforms both\nthe state-of-the-art single model and the best non-retrieval-based model over\nabout 10% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of bridging the symbolic\nand semantic worlds from math word problems.",

It has\nlong been argued that discrete math is better taught with programming, which\ntakes concepts and computing methods and turns them into executable programs.\nWhat has been lacking is a principled approach that supports all central\nconcepts of discrete math -- especially predicate logic -- and that directly\nand precisely connects math notations with executable programs. This paper\nintroduces such an approach. It is based on the use of a powerful language that\nextends the Python programming language with proper logic quantification (\"for\nall\" and \"exists some\"), as well as declarative set comprehension (also known\nas set builder) and aggregation (e.g., sum and product). Math and logical\nstatements can be expressed precisely at a high level and be executed directly\non a computer, encouraging declarative programming together with algorithmic\nprogramming.

Recently, combining large language\nmodels (LLMs) with external tools to perform complex reasoning and calculation\nhas emerged as a promising direction for solving math word problems, but prior\napproaches such as Program-Aided Language model (PAL) are biased towards simple\nprocedural problems and less effective for problems that require declarative\nreasoning. We propose an approach that combines an LLM that can incrementally\nformalize word problems as a set of variables and equations with an external\nsymbolic solver that can solve the equations. Our approach achieves comparable\naccuracy to the original PAL on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems and\noutperforms PAL by an absolute 20% on ALGEBRA, a new dataset of more\nchallenging word problems extracted from Algebra textbooks.

We propose a method of generating novel\nand high-quality datasets with math problems and their code-based solutions,\nreferred to as MathCodeInstruct.

It was shown\nthat all Gelfand--Shilov spaces $S^{\\prime 0}_\\alpha(R^k)$ ($\\alpha>1$) of\nanalytic functionals are canonically embedded in $\\mathcal U(R^k)$. While the\nusual definition of support of a generalized function is inapplicable to\nelements of $S^{\\prime 0}_\\alpha(R^k)$ and $\\mathcal U(R^k)$, their\nlocalization properties can be consistently described using the concept of {\\it\ncarrier cone} introduced by Soloviev [Lett.
