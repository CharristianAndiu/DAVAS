        "abstract": "We analyze the link between standardization and economic growth by\nsystematically reviewing leading economics journals, leading economic growth\nresearchers' articles, and economic growth-related books. We make the following\nobservations: 1) No article has analyzed the link between standardization and\neconomic growth in top5 economics journals between 1996 and 2018. 2) A\nrepresentative sample of the leading researchers of economic growth has\nallocated little attention to the link between standardization and economic\ngrowth. 3) Typically, economic growth textbooks do not contain \"standards\" or\n\"standardization\" in their word indexes. These findings suggest that the\neconomic growth theory has neglected the role of standardization.",

We consider numerous unnoted economic variables and\noverlooked economic processes those determine the states and predictions of the\nreal economics. We regard collective economic variables, collective\ntransactions and expectations, mean risks of economic variables and\ntransactions, collective velocities and flows of economic variables,\ntransactions and expectations as overlooked factors of economic evolution. We\nintroduce market-based probability of the asset price and consider unnoticed\ninfluence of market stochasticity on randomness of macroeconomic variables. We\nintroduce economic domain composed by continuous numeric risk grades and\noutline that the bounds of the economic domain result in unnoticed inherent\ncyclical motion of collective variables, transactions and expectations those\nare responsible for observed business cycles.

        "abstract": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused one of the most serious social\nand economic losses to countries around the world since the Spanish influenza\npandemic of 1918 (during World War I). It has resulted in enormous economic as\nwell as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in\na region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local\ngovernments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate\nsuppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between\neconomic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public\ninterventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major\nproblem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts\ncertain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such\neconomic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time,\nthere is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt,\nwhich is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul\nSamuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or\notherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future\ngenerations.",

        "Published: ": "2018-08-30T17:47:28Z",
        "abstract": "Development and growth are complex and tumultuous processes. Modern economic\ngrowth theories identify some key determinants of economic growth. However, the\nrelative importance of the determinants remains unknown, and additional\nvariables may help clarify the directions and dimensions of the interactions.\nThe novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate\nmeasures of productive inputs, and considers instead a more granular and\nstructural view of the productive possibilities of countries, i.e. their\ncapabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in\nexplaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ\neconomic fitness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex\nnetwork techniques. Focusing on the combined roles of fitness and some more\ntraditional drivers of growth, we build a bridge between economic growth\ntheories and the economic complexity literature. Our findings, in agreement\nwith other recent empirical studies, show that fitness plays a crucial role in\nfostering economic growth and, when it is included in the analysis, can be\neither complementary to traditional drivers of growth or can completely\novershadow them.",

The PCA-based economic policy\nuncertainty index is found to be positively related with the volatility and\ncorrelation of the global financial market, which indicates that the stocks are\nmore volatile and correlated when the global economic policy uncertainty is\nhigher.

Building on these findings, we\nstudy what we term Potterian economics, the economic ideas, insights, and\nstructure, found in Harry Potter books, to assess how the books might affect\neconomic literacy. A conservative estimate suggests that more than 7.3 percent\nof the world population has read the Harry Potter books, and millions more have\nseen their movie adaptations. These extraordinary figures underscore the\nimportance of the messages the books convey. We explore the Potterian economic\nmodel and compare it to professional economic models to assess the consistency\nof the Potterian economic principles with the existing economic models. We find\nthat some of the principles of Potterian economics are consistent with\neconomists models. Many other principles, however, are distorted and contain\nnumerous inaccuracies, contradicting professional economists views and\ninsights. We conclude that Potterian economics can teach us about the formation\nand dissemination of folk economics, the intuitive notions of naive individuals\nwho see market transactions as a zero-sum game, who care about distribution but\nfail to understand incentives and efficiency, and who think of prices as\nallocating wealth but not resources or their efficient use.",

Using\nGlobal Entrepreneurship Monitor data for a panel of 83 countries from 2002 to\n2014, we examine the contribution of entrepreneurship towards economic growth.\nOur evidence validates earlier studies findings but also exposes previously\nundiscovered findings. That is, we find that entrepreneurship encourages\neconomic growth but not in developing countries. In addition, our evidence\nfinds that the institutional environment of the country, as measured by GEM\nEntrepreneurial Framework Conditions, only contributes to economic growth in\nmore developed countries but not in developing countries. These findings have\nimportant policy implications. Namely, our evidence contradicts policy\nproposals that suggest entrepreneurship and the adoption of pro-market\ninstitutions that support it to encourage economic growth in developing\ncountries. Our evidence suggests these policy proposals will be unlikely to\ngenerate the economic growth desired.",

        "abstract": "Inferring the uncertainty in economic conditions is significant for both\ndecision makers as well as market players. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach to measure the economic uncertainties by using the Hidden Markov Model\n(HMM). We construct a dimensionless index, Economic Condition Uncertainty (ECU)\nindex, which ranges from zero to one and is comparable among sectors, regions\nand periods. We used the daily electricity consumption data of more than 18,000\nfirms in Shanghai from 2018 to 2020 to construct the ECU indexes. Results show\nthat all ECU indexes, whether at sectoral or regional level, successfully\ncaptured the negative impacts of COVID-19 on Shanghai's economic conditions.\nBesides, the ECU indexes also presented the heterogeneities in different\ndistricts as well as in different sectors. This reflects the facts that changes\nin the uncertainty of economic conditions are mainly related to regional\neconomic structures and targeted regulatory policies faced by sectors. The ECU\nindex can also be readily extended to measure the uncertainty of economic\nconditions in various realms, which has great potentials in the future.",

We treat agents risk assessments as their coordinates x\non economic space and establish distribution of all economic agents by their\nrisk coordinates. We suggest aggregation of agents and their variables by\nscales large to compare with risk scales of single agents and small to compare\nwith economic domain on economic space. Such model is alike to transition from\nkinetic description of multi-particle system to hydrodynamic approximation.\nAggregates of agents extensive variables with risk coordinate x determine macro\nvariables as functions of x alike to hydrodynamic variables. Economic and\nfinancial transactions between agents define evolution of their variables.\nAggregation of transactions between agents with risk coordinates x and y\ndetermine macro transactions as functions of x and y and define evolution of\nmacro variables at points x and y. We describe evolution and interactions\nbetween macro transactions by hydrodynamic-like system of economic equations.\nWe show that business cycles are described as consequence of the system of\neconomic equations on macro transactions. As example we describe Credit\ntransactions CL(tax,y) that provide Loans from Creditors at point x to\nBorrowers at point y and Loan-Repayment transactions LR(t,x,y) that describe\nrepayments from Borrowers at point y to Creditors at point x. We use\nhydrodynamic-like economic equations and derive from them the system of\nordinary differential equations that describe business cycle fluctuations of\nmacro Credits C(t) and macro Loan-Repayments LR(t) of the entire economics. The\nnature of business cycle fluctuations is explained as oscillations of \"mean\nrisk\" of economic variables on bounded economic domain of economic space.",

In particular, the economic content of such speeches\naffects the economy of countries and their financial markets. For this reason,\nwe examine a novel dataset containing the economic content of 951 speeches\nstated by 45 US Presidents from George Washington (April 1789) to Donald Trump\n(February 2017). In doing so, we use an economic glossary carried out by means\nof text mining techniques. The goal of our study is to examine the structure of\nsignificant interconnections within a network obtained from the economic\ncontent of presidential speeches. In such a network, nodes are represented by\ntalks and links by values of cosine similarity, the latter computed using the\noccurrences of the economic terms in the speeches. The resulting network\ndisplays a peculiar structure made up of a core (i.e. a set of highly central\nand densely connected nodes) and a periphery (i.e. a set of non-central and\nsparsely connected nodes). The presence of different economic dictionaries\nemployed by the Presidents characterize the core-periphery structure. The\nPresidents' talks belonging to the network's core share the usage of generic\n(non-technical) economic locutions like \"interest\" or \"trade\". While the use of\nmore technical and less frequent terms characterizes the periphery (e.g.\n\"yield\" ). Furthermore, the speeches close in time share a common economic\ndictionary. These results together with the economics glossary usages during\nthe US periods of boom and crisis provide unique insights on the economic\ncontent relationships among Presidents' speeches.",

Even though empirical approaches that try\nto quantify economic narratives are getting increasingly popular, there is no\ntheory or even a universally accepted definition of economic narratives\nunderlying this research. First, we review and categorize the economic\nliterature concerned with narratives and work out the different paradigms that\nare at play. Only a subset of the literature considers narratives to be active\ndrivers of economic activity. In order to solidify the foundation of narrative\neconomics, we propose a definition of collective economic narratives, isolating\nfive important characteristics. We argue that, for a narrative to be\neconomically relevant, it must be a sense-making story that emerges in a social\ncontext and suggests action to a social group. We also systematize how a\ncollective economic narrative differs from a topic and from other kinds of\nnarratives that are likely to have less impact on the economy. With regard to\nthe popular use of topic modeling as an empirical strategy, we suggest that the\ncomplementary use of other canonical methods from the natural language\nprocessing toolkit and the development of new methods is inevitable to go\nbeyond identifying topics and be able to move towards true empirical narrative\neconomics.",

        "abstract": "This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic's economic impact has\nexacerbated nutritional health disparities among women. It sought to understand\nthe effects of economic challenges on women's dietary choices and access to\nnutritious food across different socioeconomic groups. Using a mixed-methods\napproach, the research combined quantitative data from health and economic\nrecords with qualitative insights from interviews with diverse women. The study\nanalyzed trends in nutritional health and economic factors before and after the\npandemic and gathered personal accounts regarding nutrition and economic\ndifficulties during this period. Findings showed a clear link between the\neconomic downturn and deteriorating nutritional health, particularly in\nlow-income and marginalized groups. These women reported decreased access to\nhealthy foods and an increased dependence on less nutritious options due to\nbudget constraints, leading to a decline in dietary quality. This trend was\nless evident in higher-income groups, highlighting stark disparities. The\npandemic intensified pre-existing nutritional inequalities, with the most\nvulnerable groups facing greater adverse effects. However, community support\nand public health measures provided some relief. In summary, the pandemic's\neconomic repercussions have indirectly impaired women's nutritional health,\nespecially among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. This highlights the\nnecessity for tailored nutritional interventions and economic policies focused\non safeguarding women's health.",

        "Published: ": "2008-01-02T13:23:04Z",
        "abstract": "It is hard to exaggerate the role of economic aggregators -- functions that\nsummarize numerous and / or heterogeneous data -- in economic models since the\nearly XX$^{th}$ century. In many cases, as witnessed by the pioneering works of\nCobb and Douglas, these functions were information quantities tailored to\neconomic theories, i.e. they were built to fit economic phenomena. In this\npaper, we look at these functions from the complementary side: information. We\nuse a recent toolbox built on top of a vast class of distortions coined by\nBregman, whose application field rivals metrics' in various subfields of\nmathematics. This toolbox makes it possible to find the quality of an\naggregator (for consumptions, prices, labor, capital, wages, etc.), from the\nstandpoint of the information it carries. We prove a rather striking result.\n  From the informational standpoint, well-known economic aggregators do belong\nto the \\textit{optimal} set. As common economic assumptions enter the analysis,\nthis large set shrinks, and it essentially ends up \\textit{exactly fitting}\neither CES, or Cobb-Douglas, or both. To summarize, in the relevant economic\ncontexts, one could not have crafted better some aggregator from the\ninformation standpoint. We also discuss global economic behaviors of optimal\ninformation aggregators in general, and present a brief panorama of the links\nbetween economic and information aggregators.\n  Keywords: Economic Aggregators, CES, Cobb-Douglas, Bregman divergences",

        "Published: ": "2021-08-05T17:42:35Z",
        "abstract": "AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have improved many areas, but are not yet\nwidely adopted in economic policy design, mechanism design, or economics at\nlarge. At the same time, current economic methodology is limited by a lack of\ncounterfactual data, simplistic behavioral models, and limited opportunities to\nexperiment with policies and evaluate behavioral responses. Here we show that\nmachine-learning-based economic simulation is a powerful policy and mechanism\ndesign framework to overcome these limitations. The AI Economist is a\ntwo-level, deep RL framework that trains both agents and a social planner who\nco-adapt, providing a tractable solution to the highly unstable and novel\ntwo-level RL challenge. From a simple specification of an economy, we learn\nrational agent behaviors that adapt to learned planner policies and vice versa.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the AI Economist on the problem of optimal\ntaxation. In simple one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal\ntax policy of economic theory. In complex, dynamic economies, the AI Economist\nsubstantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off\nbetween equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent\ntax-gaming strategies, while accounting for agent interactions and behavioral\nchange more accurately than economic theory. These results demonstrate for the\nfirst time that two-level, deep RL can be used for understanding and as a\ncomplement to theory for economic design, unlocking a new computational\nlearning-based approach to understanding economic policy.",

        "abstract": "Economic systems play pivotal roles in the metaverse. However, we have not\nyet found an overview that systematically introduces economic systems for the\nmetaverse. Therefore, we review the state-of-the-art solutions, architectures,\nand systems related to economic systems. When investigating those\nstate-of-the-art studies, we keep two questions in our mind: (1) what is the\nframework of economic systems in the context of the metaverse, and (2) what\nactivities would economic systems engage in the metaverse? This article aims to\ndisclose insights into the economic systems that work for both the current and\nthe future metaverse. To have a clear overview of the economic-system\nframework, we mainly discuss the connections among three fundamental elements\nin the metaverse, i.e., digital creation, digital assets, and the digital\ntrading market. After that, we elaborate on each topic of the proposed\neconomic-system framework. Those topics include incentive mechanisms, monetary\nsystems, digital wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, and\ncross-platform interoperability for the metaverse. For each topic, we mainly\ndiscuss three questions: a) the rationale of this topic, b) why the metaverse\nneeds this topic, and c) how this topic will evolve in the metaverse. Through\nthis overview, we wish readers can better understand what economic systems the\nmetaverse needs, and the insights behind the economic activities in the\nmetaverse.",

        "abstract": "The processes of ecological interactions, dispersal and mutations shape the\ndynamics of biological communities, and analogous eco-evolutionary processes\nacting upon economic entities have been proposed to explain economic change.\nThis hypothesis is compelling because it explains economic change through\nendogenous mechanisms, but it has not been quantitatively tested at the global\neconomy level. Here, we use an inverse modelling technique and 59 years of\neconomic data covering 77 countries to test whether the collective dynamics of\nnational economic activities can be characterised by eco-evolutionary\nprocesses. We estimate the statistical support of dynamic community models in\nwhich the dynamics of economic activities are coupled with positive and\nnegative interactions between the activities, the spatial dispersal of the\nactivities, and their transformations into other economic activities. We find\nstrong support for the models capturing positive interactions between economic\nactivities and spatial dispersal of the activities across countries. These\nresults suggest that processes akin to those occurring in ecosystems play a\nsignificant role in the dynamics of economic systems. The strength-of-evidence\nobtained for each model varies across countries and may be caused by\ndifferences in the distance between countries, specific institutional contexts,\nand historical contingencies. Overall, our study provides a new quantitative,\nbiologically inspired framework to study the forces shaping economic change.",

        "abstract": "Energy supply is mandatory for the production of economic value.\nNevertheless, tradition dictates that an enigmatic 'invisible hand' governs\neconomic valuation. Physical scientists have long proposed alternative but\ntestable energy cost theories of economic valuation, and have shown the gross\ncorrelation between energy consumption and economic output at the national\nlevel through input-output energy analysis. However, due to the difficulty of\nprecise energy analysis and highly complicated real markets, no decisive\nevidence directly linking energy costs to the selling prices of individual\ncommodities has yet been found. Over the past century, the US metal market has\naccumulated a huge body of price data, which for the first time ever provides\nus the opportunity to quantitatively examine the direct energy-value\ncorrelation. Here, by analyzing the market price data of 65 purified chemical\nelements (mainly metals) relative to the total energy consumption for refining\nthem from naturally occurring geochemical conditions, we found a clear\ncorrelation between the energy cost and their market prices. The underlying\nphysics we proposed has compatibility with conventional economic concepts such\nas the ratio between supply and demand or scarcity's role in economic\nvaluation. It demonstrates how energy cost serves as the 'invisible hand'\ngoverning economic valuation. Thorough understanding of this energy connection\nbetween the human economic and the Earth's biogeochemical metabolism is\nessential for improving the overall energy efficiency and furthermore the\nsustainability of the human society.",

        "abstract": "It has been found that human mobility exhibits random patterns following the\nLevy flight, where human movement contains many short flights and some long\nflights, and these flights follow a power-law distribution. In this paper, we\nstudy the social-economical development trajectories of urban cities. We\nobserve that social-economical movement of cities also exhibit the Levy flight\ncharacteristics. We collect the social and economical data such as the\npopulation, the number of students, GDP and personal income, etc. from several\ncities. Then we map these urban data into the social and economical factors\nthrough a deep-learning embedding method Auto-Encoder. We find that the\nsocial-economical factors of these cities can be fitted approximately as a\nmovement pattern of a power-law distribution. We use the Stochastic\nMultiplicative Processes (SMP) to explain such movement, where in the presence\nof a boundary constraint, the SMP leads to a power law distribution. It means\nthat the social-economical trajectories of cities also follow a Levy flight\npattern, where some years have large changes in terms of social-economical\ndevelopment, and many years have little changes.",

        "abstract": "Most national economies are linked by international trade. Consequently,\neconomic globalization forms a massive and complex economic network with strong\nlinks, that is, interactions arising from increasing trade. Various interesting\ncollective motions are expected to emerge from strong economic interactions in\na global economy under trade liberalization. Among the various economic\ncollective motions, economic crises are our most intriguing problem. In our\nprevious studies, we have revealed that the Kuramoto's coupled limit-cycle\noscillator model and the Ising-like spin model on networks are invaluable tools\nfor characterizing the economic crises. In this study, we develop a\nmathematical theory to describe an interacting agent model that derives the\nKuramoto model and the Ising-like spin model by using appropriate\napproximations. Our interacting agent model suggests phase synchronization and\nspin ordering during economic crises. We confirm the emergence of the phase\nsynchronization and spin ordering during economic crises by analyzing various\neconomic time series data. We also develop a network reconstruction model based\non entropy maximization that considers the sparsity of the network. Here\nnetwork reconstruction means estimating a network's adjacency matrix from a\nnode's local information. The interbank network is reconstructed using the\ndeveloped model, and a comparison is made of the reconstructed network with the\nactual data. We successfully reproduce the interbank network and the known\nstylized facts. In addition, the exogenous shock acting on an industry\ncommunity in a supply chain network and financial sector are estimated.\nEstimation of exogenous shocks acting on communities of in the real economy in\nthe supply chain network provide evidence of the channels of distress\npropagating from the financial sector to the real economy through the supply\nchain network.",

Such relatively trivial\nestimates of economic damages -- when these economists otherwise assume that\nhuman economic productivity will be an order of magnitude higher than today --\ncontrast strongly with predictions made by scientists of significantly reduced\nhuman habitability from climate change. Nonetheless, the coupled economic and\nclimate models used to make such predictions have been influential in the\ninternational climate change debate and policy prescriptions. Here we review\nthe empirical work done by economists and show that it severely underestimates\ndamages from climate change by committing several methodological errors,\nincluding neglecting tipping points, and assuming that economic sectors not\nexposed to the weather are insulated from climate change. Most fundamentally,\nthe influential Integrated Assessment Model DICE is shown to be incapable of\ngenerating an economic collapse, regardless of the level of damages. Given\nthese flaws, economists' empirical estimates of economic damages from global\nwarming should be rejected as unscientific, and models that have been\ncalibrated to them, such as DICE, should not be used to evaluate economic risks\nfrom climate change, or in the development of policy to attenuate damages.",

        "abstract": "The development of trajectory-based operations and the rolling network\noperations plan in European air traffic management network implies a move\ntowards more collaborative, strategic flight planning. This opens up the\npossibility for inclusion of additional information in the collaborative\ndecision-making process. With that in mind, we define the indicator for the\neconomic risk of network elements (e.g., sectors or airports) as the expected\ncosts that the elements impose on airspace users due to Air Traffic Flow\nManagement (ATFM) regulations. The definition of the indicator is based on the\nanalysis of historical ATFM regulations data, that provides an indication of\nthe risk of accruing delay. This risk of delay is translated into a monetary\nrisk for the airspace users, creating the new metric of the economic risk of a\ngiven airspace element. We then use some machine learning techniques to find\nthe parameters leading to this economic risk. The metric is accompanied by an\nindication of the accuracy of the delay cost prediction model. Lastly, the\neconomic risk is transformed into a qualitative economic severity\nclassification. The economic risks and consequently economic severity can be\nestimated for different temporal horizons and time periods providing an\nindicator which can be used by Air Navigation Service Providers to identify\nareas which might need the implementation of strategic measures (e.g.,\nresectorisation or capacity provision change), and by Airspace Users to\nconsider operation of routes which use specific airspace regions.",

        "abstract": "Contrary to conventional economic growth theory, which reduces a country's\noutput to one aggregate variable (GDP), product diversity is central to\neconomic development, as recent 'economic complexity' research suggests. A\ncountry's product diversity reflects its diversity of knowhow or\n'capabilities'. Researchers proposed the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and\nthe country Fitness index to estimate a country's number of capabilities from\ninternational export data; these measures predict economic growth better than\nconventional variables such as human capital. This paper offers a simpler\nmeasure of a country's knowhow, Log Product Diversity (or LPD, the logarithm of\na country's number of products), which can be derived from a one-parameter\ncombinatorial model of production in which a set of knowhows combine with some\nprobability to turn raw materials into a product. ECI and log-fitness can be\ninterpreted theoretically (using the combinatorial model) and empirically as\npotentially noisy estimates of LPD; moreover, controlling for natural\nresources, the simple measure better explains the cross-country differences in\nGDP and in GDP per capita.",

        "abstract": "Economic growth in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, countries of the\nformer USSR, Africa and Latin America were analysed. It is demonstrated that\nthe fundamental postulate of the Unified Growth Theory about the existence of\nthe three regimes of growth (Malthusian regime, post-Malthusian regime and\nsustained-growth regime) is contradicted by data. These regimes did not exist.\nIn particular, there was no escape from the Malthusian trap because there was\nno trap. Economic growth in all these regions was not stagnant but hyperbolic.\nUnified Growth Theory is fundamentally incorrect. However, this theory is also\ndangerously misleading because it claims a transition from the endless epoch of\nstagnation to the new era of sustained economic growth, the interpretation\ncreating the sense of security and a promise of prosperity. The data show that\nthe opposite is true. Economic growth in the past was sustained and secure.\nNow, it is supported by the increasing ecological deficit. The long-term\nsustained and secure economic growth has yet to be created. It did not happen\nautomatically, as suggested incorrectly by the Unified Growth Theory.",

Our results shed a new light on the ECI's empirical success in\nexplaining cross-country differences in GDP/capita and economic growth, which\nis often linked to the diversity of country export baskets.

        "abstract": "How much knowledge is there in an economy? In recent years, data on the mix\nof products that countries export has been used to construct measures of\neconomic complexity that estimate the knowledge available in an economy and\npredict future economic growth. Here we introduce a new and simpler metric of\neconomic complexity (ECI+) that measures the total exports of an economy\ncorrected by how difficult it is to export each product. We use data from 1973\nto 2013 to compare the ability of ECI+, the Economic Complexity Index (ECI),\nand Fitness complexity, to predict future economic growth using 5, 10, and\n20-year panels in a pooled OLS, a random effects model, and a fixed effects\nmodel. We find that ECI+ outperforms ECI and Fitness in its ability to predict\neconomic growth and in the consistency of its estimators across most\neconometric specifications. On average, one standard deviation increase in ECI+\nis associated with an increase in annualized growth of about 4% to 5%. We then\ncombine ECI+ with measures of physical capital, human capital, and\ninstitutions, to find a robust model of economic growth. The ability of ECI+ to\npredict growth, and the value of its coefficient, is robust to these controls.\nAlso, we find that human capital, political stability, and control of\ncorruption; are positively associated with future economic growth, and that\nincome is negatively associated with growth, in agreement with the traditional\ngrowth literature. Finally, we use ECI+ to generate economic growth predictions\nfor the next 20 years and compare these predictions with the ones obtained\nusing ECI and Fitness. These findings improve the methods available to estimate\nthe knowledge intensity of economies and predict future economic growth.",

        "abstract": "Macroeconomics essentially discusses macroeconomic phenomena from the\nperspectives of various schools of economic thought, each of which takes\ndifferent views on how macroeconomic agents make decisions and how the\ncorresponding markets operate. Therefore, developing a clear, comprehensive\nunderstanding of how and in what ways these schools of economic thought differ\nis a key and a prerequisite for economics students to prosper academically and\nprofessionally in the discipline. This becomes even more crucial as economics\nstudents pursue their studies toward higher levels of education and graduate\nschool, during which students are expected to attain higher levels of Bloom's\ntaxonomy, including analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and creation. Teaching the\ndistinctions and similarities of the two major schools of economic thought has\nnever been an easy task to undertake in the classroom. Although the reason for\nsuch a hardship can be multi-fold, one reason has undoubtedly been students'\nlack of a holistic view on how the two mainstream economic schools of thought\ndiffer. There is strong evidence that students make smoother transition to\nhigher levels of education after building up such groundwork, on which they can\nbuild further later on (e.g. Didia and Hasnat, 1998; Marcal and Roberts, 2001;\nIslam, et al., 2008; Green, et al., 2009; White, 2016). The paper starts with a\nvisual spectrum of various schools of economic thought, and then narrows down\nthe scope to the classical and Keynesian schools, i.e. the backbone of modern\nmacroeconomics. Afterwards, a holistic table contrasts the two schools in terms\nof 50 aspects.

As in statistical\nphysics, thermodynamic macroeconomic variables emerge as the mean value of\nmicroeconomic variables and their determination is reduced to the computation\nof the partition function, starting from an arbitrary function. Explicit\nhypothetical examples are given which include linear and nonlinear economic\nsystems, as well as multiplicative systems such as those dominated by a Pareto\nlaw distribution.

        "abstract": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides financial assistance to its\nmember-countries in economic turmoil, but requires at the same time that these\ncountries reform their public policies. In several contexts, these reforms are\nat odds with population health. While researchers have empirically analyzed the\nconsequences of these reforms on health, no analysis exist on identifying fair\ntradeoffs between consequences on population health and economic outcomes. Our\narticle analyzes and identifies the principles governing these tradeoffs.\nFirst, this article reviews existing policy-evaluation studies, which show, on\nbalance, that IMF policies frequently cause adverse effects on child health and\nmaterial standards in the pursuit of macroeconmic improvement. Second, this\narticle discusses four theories in distributive ethics (maximization,\negalitarianianism, prioritarianiasm, and sufficientarianism) to identify which\nis the most compatible with the core mission of the IMF, that is, improved\nmacroeconomics (Articles of Agreement) while at the same time balancing\nconsequences on health. Using a distributive-ethics analyses of IMF polices, we\nargue that sufficientarianism is the most compatible theory. Third, this\narticle offer a qualitative rearticulation of the Articles of Agreement, and\nformalize sufficientarian principles in the language of causal inference. We\nalso offer a framework on how to empirically measure, from observational data,\nthe extent that IMF policies trade off fairly between population health and\neconomic outcomes.

Market expectations\nplummeted, foreshadowing the risk of a global economic crisis and mass\nunemployment. Governments provide huge financial aid programmes to mitigate the\neconomic shocks. To achieve higher effectiveness with such policy measures, it\nis key to identify the industries that are most in need of support. In this\nstudy, we introduce a data-mining approach to measure industry-specific risks\nrelated to COVID-19. We examine company risk reports filed to the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This alternative data set can\ncomplement more traditional economic indicators in times of the fast-evolving\ncrisis as it allows for a real-time analysis of risk assessments. Preliminary\nfindings suggest that the companies' awareness towards corona-related business\nrisks is ahead of the overall stock market developments. Our approach allows to\ndistinguish the industries by their risk awareness towards COVID-19. Based on\nnatural language processing, we identify corona-related risk topics and their\nperceived relevance for different industries. The preliminary findings are\nsummarised as an up-to-date online index. The CoRisk-Index tracks the\nindustry-specific risk assessments related to the crisis, as it spreads through\nthe economy. The tracking tool is updated weekly. It could provide relevant\nempirical data to inform models on the economic effects of the crisis.

        "abstract": "Cycles in graphs often signify interesting processes. For example, cyclic\ntrading patterns can indicate inefficiencies or economic dependencies in trade\nnetworks, cycles in food webs can identify fragile dependencies in ecosystems,\nand cycles in financial transaction networks can be an indication of money\nlaundering. Identifying such interesting cycles, which can also be constrained\nto contain a given set of query nodes, although not extensively studied, is\nthus a problem of considerable importance. In this paper, we introduce the\nproblem of discovering interesting cycles in graphs. We first address the\nproblem of quantifying the extent to which a given cycle is interesting for a\nparticular analyst. We then show that finding cycles according to this\ninterestingness measure is related to the longest cycle and maximum mean-weight\ncycle problems (in the unconstrained setting) and to the maximum Steiner cycle\nand maximum mean Steiner cycle problems (in the constrained setting). A\ncomplexity analysis shows that finding interesting cycles is NP-hard, and is\nNP-hard to approximate within a constant factor in the unconstrained setting,\nand within a factor polynomial in the input size for the constrained setting.\nThe latter inapproximability result implies a similar result for the maximum\nSteiner cycle and maximum mean Steiner cycle problems. Motivated by these\nhardness results, we propose a number of efficient heuristic algorithms. We\nverify the effectiveness of the proposed methods and demonstrate their\npractical utility on two real-world use cases: a food web and an international\ntrade-network dataset.",

Such\nlockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study\nexamines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact\nthrough supply chains, a network of firms for production, simulating an\nagent-based model of production on supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in\nJapan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the\ninteractions of lockdowns, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by\ndecomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We\nfind that a region's upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier\nsubstitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the\neconomic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region\nlifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on\nwhether it lifts lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked\nthrough supply chains. These results propose the need for inter-region policy\ncoordination to reduce the economic loss from lockdowns.",

The results show that, first, during the\n2007-2008 global financial crisis, the guarantee network became smaller, less\nconnected and more stable because of many bankruptcies; second, the stimulus\nprogram encouraged mutual guarantee behaviors, resulting in highly reciprocal\nand fragile network structure; third, the following monetary policy adjustment\nenhanced the resilience of the guarantee network by reducing mutual guarantees.\nInterestingly, our work reveals that the financial crisis made the network more\nresilient, and conversely, the government bailout degenerated network\nresilience. These counterintuitive findings can provide new insight into the\nresilience of real-world credit system under external shocks or rescues.",

        "abstract": "This paper characterizes the equilibrium in a continuous time financial\nmarket populated by heterogeneous agents who differ in their rate of relative\nrisk aversion and face convex portfolio constraints. The model is studied in an\napplication to margin constraints and found to match real world observations\nabout financial variables and leverage cycles. It is shown how margin\nconstraints increase the market price of risk and decrease the interest rate by\nforcing more risk averse agents to hold more risky assets, producing a higher\nequity risk premium. In addition, heterogeneity and margin constraints are\nshown to produce both pro- and counter-cyclical leverage cycles. Beyond two\ntypes, it is shown how constraints can cascade and how leverage can exhibit\nhighly non-linear dynamics. Finally, empirical results are given, documenting a\nnovel stylized fact which is predicted by the model, namely that the leverage\ncycle is both pro- and counter-cyclical.",

        "abstract": "The financial crisis showed the importance of measuring, allocating and\nregulating systemic risk. Recently, the systemic risk measures that can be\ndecomposed into an aggregation function and a scalar measure of risk, received\na lot of attention. In this framework, capital allocations are added after\naggregation and can represent bailout costs. More recently, a framework has\nbeen introduced, where institutions are supplied with capital allocations\nbefore aggregation. This yields an interpretation that is particularly useful\nfor regulatory purposes. In each framework, the set of all feasible capital\nallocations leads to a multivariate risk measure. In this paper, we present\ndual representations for scalar systemic risk measures as well as for the\ncorresponding multivariate risk measures concerning capital allocations. Our\nresults cover both frameworks: aggregating after allocating and allocating\nafter aggregation. As examples, we consider the aggregation mechanisms of the\nEisenberg-Noe model as well as those of the resource allocation and network\nflow models.",

This trend--cycle decomposition has a relevant impact on\nseveral economic and fiscal variables and constitutes by itself an important\nindicator for policy purposes. This paper deals with trend--cycle decomposition\nfor the Italian economy having some interesting peculiarities which makes it\nattractive to analyse from both a statistic and an historical perspective. We\npropose an univariate model for the quarterly real GDP, subsequently extended\nto include the price dynamics through a Phillips curve. This study considers a\nseries of the Italian quarterly real GDP recently released by OECD which\nincludes both the 1960s and the recent global financial crisis of 2007--2008.\nParameters estimate as well as the signal extraction are performed within the\nBayesian paradigm which effectively handles complex models where the parameters\nenter the log--likelihood function in a strongly nonlinear way. A new Adaptive\nIndependent Metropolis--within--Gibbs sampler is then developed to efficiently\nsimulate the parameters of the unobserved cycle. Our results suggest that\ninflation influences the Output Gap estimate, making the extracted Italian OG\nan important indicator of inflation pressures on the real side of the economy,\nas stated by the Phillips theory.

Using\nboth monthly and weekly data, we found very similar lead-lag dependence between\nthe S&P500 stock market index and the yields of bonds inside two groups: bond\nyields of short-term maturities (Federal funds rate (FFR), 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, and\n3Y) and bond yields of long-term maturities (5Y, 7Y, 10Y, and 20Y). In all\ncases, we observe the opposite of (i) and (ii). First, the stock market and\nyields move in the same direction. Second, the stock market leads the yields,\nincluding and especially the FFR. Moreover, we find that the short-term yields\nin the first group lead the long-term yields in the second group before the\nfinancial crisis that started mid-2007 and the inverse relationship holds\nafterwards. These results suggest that the Federal Reserve is increasingly\nmindful of the stock market behavior, seen at key to the recovery and health of\nthe economy. Long-term investors seem also to have been more reactive and\nmindful of the signals provided by the financial stock markets than the Federal\nReserve itself after the start of the financial crisis. The lead of the S&P500\nstock market index over the bond yields of all maturities is confirmed by the\ntraditional lagged cross-correlation analysis.",

In\norder to adapt to the economic environment, decision-makers across the public\nand private sectors require accurate forecasts of the economic outlook.\nExisting predictive frameworks base their forecasts primarily on time series\nanalysis, as well as the judgments of experts. As a consequence, current\napproaches are often biased and prone to error. In order to reduce forecast\nerrors, this paper presents an innovative methodology that extends lag\nvariables with unstructured data in the form of financial news: (1) we apply a\nvariety of models from machine learning to word counts as a high-dimensional\ninput. However, this approach suffers from low interpretability and\noverfitting, motivating the following remedies. (2) We follow the intuition\nthat the economic climate is driven by general sentiments and suggest a\nprojection of words onto latent semantic structures as a means of feature\nengineering. (3) We propose a semantic path model, together with estimation\ntechnique based on regularization, in order to yield full interpretability of\nthe forecasts. We demonstrate the predictive performance of our approach by\nutilizing 80,813 ad hoc announcements in order to make long-term forecasts of\nup to 24 months ahead regarding key macroeconomic indicators.

Yet, due\nto a relative lack of reliable, system wide data, many such theories remain, at\nbest, unvalidated and, at worst, misleading. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel economic observatory and framework enabling high resolution comparisons\nand assessments of the distributional impact of economic development through\nthe remote sensing of planet earth's surface. Striking visual and empirical\nvalidation is observed for a broad, global macroeconomic sigma-convergence in\nthe period immediately following the end of the Cold War. What is more, we\nobserve strong empirical evidence that the mechanisms driving sigma-convergence\nfailed immediately after the financial crisis and the start of the Great\nRecession. Nevertheless, analysis of both cross-country and cross-state samples\nindicates that, globally, disproportionately high growth levels and excessively\nhigh decay levels have become rarer over time. We also see that urban areas,\nespecially concentrated within short distances of major capital cities were\nmore likely than rural or suburban areas to see relatively high growth in the\naftermath of the financial crisis. Observed changes in growth polarity can be\nattributed plausibly to post-crisis government intervention and subsidy\npolicies introduced around the world. Overall, the data and techniques we\npresent here make economic evidence for the rise of China, the decline of U.S.\nmanufacturing, the euro crisis, the Arab Spring, and various, recent, Middle\nEast conflicts visually evident for the first time.",

Moreover, we show that the\neconomic information is hidden at different levels of the hierarchical\nstructures depending on the clustering method. The dynamical analysis on a\nrolling window also reveals that the different methods show different degrees\nof sensitivity to events affecting financial markets, like crises.

By defining and tracking the more\ninefficient practices of the food supply chain and their effects, we can better\nunderstand how to improve agricultural performance, track nutrition values, and\nfocus on the reduction of a major risk to the environment while contributing to\nfood security. Our aim is to propose a framework for a food supply chain,\ndevoted to the vision of zero waste and zero emissions, and at the same time,\nfulfilling the broad commitment on inclusive green economy within the climate\naction. To set the groundwork for a smart city solution which achieves this\nvision, main indicators and evaluation frameworks are introduced, followed by\nthe drill down into most crucial problems, both globally and locally, in a case\nstudy in north Italy. Methane is on the rise in the climate agenda, and\nspecifically in Italy emission mitigation is difficult to achieve in the\nfarming sector. Accordingly, going from the generic frameworks towards a\nfederation deployment, we provide the reasoning for a cost-effective use case\nin the domain of food, to create a valuable digital twin. A Bayesian approach\nto assess use cases and select preferred scenarios is proposed, realizing the\npotential of the digital twin flexibility with FAIR data, while understanding\nand acting to achieve environmental and social goals, i.e., coping\nuncertainties, and combining green employment and food security. The proposed\nframework can be adjusted to organizational, financial, and political\nconsiderations in different locations worldwide, rethinking the value of\ninformation in the context of FAIR data in digital twins.",

        "abstract": "Effective risk control must make a tradeoff between the microprudential risk\nof exogenous shocks to individual institutions and the macroprudential risks\ncaused by their systemic interactions. We investigate a simple dynamical model\nfor understanding this tradeoff, consisting of a bank with a leverage target\nand an unleveraged fundamental investor subject to exogenous noise with\nclustered volatility. The parameter space has three regions: (i) a stable\nregion, where the system always reaches a fixed point equilibrium; (ii) a\nlocally unstable region, characterized by cycles and chaotic behavior; and\n(iii) a globally unstable region. A crude calibration of parameters to data\nputs the model in region (ii). In this region there is a slowly building price\nbubble, resembling a \"Great Moderation\", followed by a crash, with a period of\napproximately 10-15 years, which we dub the \"Basel leverage cycle\". We propose\na criterion for rating macroprudential policies based on their ability to\nminimize risk for a given average leverage. We construct a one parameter family\nof leverage policies that allows us to vary from the procyclical policies of\nBasel II or III, in which leverage decreases when volatility increases, to\ncountercyclical policies in which leverage increases when volatility increases.\nWe find the best policy depends critically on three parameters: The average\nleverage used by the bank; the relative size of the bank and the\nfundamentalist, and the amplitude of the exogenous noise. Basel II is optimal\nwhen the exogenous noise is high, the bank is small and leverage is low; in the\nopposite limit where the bank is large or leverage is high the optimal policy\nis closer to constant leverage.

Feeding into this model a novel intensity-adjusted\nmacroprudential policy index, we find that tighter MPPs may be effective in\ncontaining domestic private sector credit growth and the volumes of gross\ncapital inflows in a majority of the countries analyzed. However, they do not\nseem to generally shield CESEE countries from capital flow volatility.",

We derive a unified closed-form\nformula of the optimal portfolio, which is a four-term division. The formula\nhas clear economic meanings, reflecting the behavior of risk aversion, risk\nseeking, loss aversion and first-order risk aversion. We conduct a general\nasymptotic analysis to the optimal portfolio, which directly serves as an\nanalytical tool for financial analysis. We compare this PHARA portfolio with\nthose of other utility families both analytically and numerically. One main\nfinding is that risk-taking behaviors are greatly increased by non-concavity\nand reduced by non-differentiability of the PHARA utility.

        "abstract": "After the 2007/2008 financial crisis, the UK government decided that a change\nin regulation was required to amend the poor control of financial markets. The\nFinancial Services Act 2012 was developed as a result in order to give more\ncontrol and authority to the regulators of financial markets. Thus, the\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) succeeded the Financial Services Authority\n(FSA). An area requiring an improvement in regulation was insider trading. Our\nstudy examines the effectiveness of the FCA in its duty of regulating insider\ntrading through utilising the event study methodology to assess abnormal\nreturns in the run-up to the first announcement of mergers. Samples of abnormal\nreturns are examined on periods, under regulation either by the FSA or by the\nFCA. Practically, stock price data on the London Stock Exchange from 2008-2012\nand 2015-2019 is investigated. The results from this study determine that\nabnormal returns are reduced after the implementation of the Financial Services\nAct 2012; prices are also found to be noisier in the period before the 2012\nAct. Insignificant abnormal returns are found in the run-up to the first\nannouncement of mergers in the 2015-2019 period. This concludes that the FCA is\nefficient in regulating insider trading.",

This pricing problem is crucial for financial\ndecision making and was studied intensively, however, many open questions still\nremain.

The paper suggests a pricing method based on the risk\nminimization such that both producer and customer seek to minimize the mean\nsquare hedging error accepted as a measure of risk. This leads to two different\nversions of the pricing problem: the selection of the annuity price given the\nrate of regular payments, and the selection of the rate of payments given the\nannuity price. It appears that solutions of these two problems are different.\nThis can contribute to explanation for the \"annuity puzzle\".",

        "Published: ": "2019-07-11T10:58:09Z",
        "abstract": "Feed in tariff (FiT) is one of the most efficient ways that many governments\nthroughout the world use to stimulate investment in renewable energies (REs)\ntechnology. For governments, financial management of the policy is very\nchallenging as that it needs a considerable amount of budget to support RE\nproducers during the long remuneration period. In this paper, we illuminate\nthat the early growth of REs capacity could be a temporary boost and the system\nelements would backlash the policy if financial circumstances are not handled\nwell. To show this, we chose Iran as the case, which is in the infancy period\nof FiT implementation. Iran started the implementation of FiT policy in 2015\naiming to achieve 5 GW of renewable capacity until 2021. Analyses show that the\nprobable financial crisis will not only lead to inefficient REs development\nafter the target time (2021), but may also cause the existing plants to fail.\nSocial tolerance for paying REs tax and potential investors trust emanated from\nbudget related mechanisms are taken into consideration in the system dynamics\nmodel developed in this research to reflect those financial effects, which have\nrarely been considered in the previous researches. To prevent the financial\ncrisis of the FiT funding and to maintain the stable growth in long term, three\npolicy scenarios are analyzed: continuation of the current program with higher\nFiT rates, adjusting the FiT rates based on the budget status, and adjusting\nthe tax on electricity consumption for the development of REs based on the\nbudget status. The results demonstrate that adjusting the tax on electricity\nconsumption for the development of REs based on budget status leads to the best\npolicy result for a desired installed capacity development without any negative\nsocial effects and financial crises.",

        "Published: ": "2020-06-04T17:02:52Z",
        "abstract": "One of the most challenging aspects in the analysis and modelling of\nfinancial markets, including Credit Default Swap (CDS) markets, is the presence\nof an emergent, intermediate level of structure standing in between the\nmicroscopic dynamics of individual financial entities and the macroscopic\ndynamics of the market as a whole. This elusive, mesoscopic level of\norganisation is often sought for via factor models that ultimately decompose\nthe market according to geographic regions and economic industries. However, at\na more general level the presence of mesoscopic structure might be revealed in\nan entirely data-driven approach, looking for a modular and possibly\nhierarchical organisation of the empirical correlation matrix between financial\ntime series. The crucial ingredient in such an approach is the definition of an\nappropriate null model for the correlation matrix. Recent research showed that\ncommunity detection techniques developed for networks become intrinsically\nbiased when applied to correlation matrices. For this reason, a method based on\nRandom Matrix Theory has been developed, which identifies the optimal\nhierarchical decomposition of the system into internally correlated and\nmutually anti-correlated communities. Building upon this technique, here we\nresolve the mesoscopic structure of the CDS market and identify groups of\nissuers that cannot be traced back to standard industry/region taxonomies,\nthereby being inaccessible to standard factor models. We use this decomposition\nto introduce a novel default risk model that is shown to outperform more\ntraditional alternatives.",

For property and casualty (P&C) insurance companies the risk\nadequate modelling of the claim reserves is a very important topic as this\nliabilities determine up to 70% percent of the balance sum. We propose a three\ndimensional (3D) stochastic model for claim reserving. It delivers consistently\nthe reserve's distribution function as well as the distributions of all parts\nof it that are needed for accounting and controlling. The calibration methods\nfor the model are well known from data analysis and they are applicable in an\npractitioner environment. We evaluate the model numerically by the help of\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulation. Classical actuarial reserve models are two\ndimensional (2D). They lead to an estimation algorithm that is applied on a 2D\nmatrix, the run off triangle. Those methods (for instance the Chain - Ladder or\nthe Bornhuetter - Ferguson method) are widely used in practice nowadays and\ngive rise to several problems: They estimate the reserves' expectation and some\nof them - under very restriction assumptions - the variance. They provide no\ninformation about the tail of the reserve's distribution, what would be most\nimportant for risk calculation, for assessing the insurance company's financial\nstability and economic situation. Additionally, due to the projection of the\nclaim process into a two dimensional space the results are very often distorted\nand dependent on the kind of projection. Therefore we extend the classical 2D\nmodels to a 3D space because we find inconsistencies generated by inadequate\nprojections into the 2D spaces.",

        "abstract": "Repeated history of pandemics, such as SARS, H1N1, Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19,\nhas shown that pandemic risk is inevitable. Extraordinary shortages of medical\nresources have been observed in many parts of the world. Some attributing\nfactors include the lack of sufficient stockpiles and the lack of coordinated\nefforts to deploy existing resources to the location of greatest needs. The\npaper investigates contingency planning and resources allocation from a risk\nmanagement perspective, as opposed to the prevailing supply chain perspective.\nThe key idea is that the competition of limited critical resources is not only\npresent in different geographical locations but also at different stages of a\npandemic. This paper draws on an analogy between risk aggregation and capital\nallocation in finance and pandemic resources planning and allocation for\nhealthcare systems. The main contribution is to introduce new strategies for\noptimal stockpiling and allocation balancing spatio-temporal competitions of\nmedical supply and demand.",

Using financial networks constructed from real Italian money\nmarket data and using realistic parameters, we show that the cascade risk can\nbe substantially reduced by a small rate of taxation and by means of a simple\nstrategy of the money transfer from the rescue fund to interbanking market\nsubjects. Furthermore, we show that while negative effects on the return on\ninvestment ($ROI$) are direct and certain, an overall positive effect on risk\nadjusted return on investments ($ROI^{RA}$) is visible.

        "abstract": "The money supply is endogenous if the monetary policy strategy is the so\ncalled Inflation and Interest Rate Targeting, IRT. With that and perfect\ncredibility, the theory of the price level and inflation only needs the Fisher\nequation, but it interprets causality in a new sense: if the monetary authority\nraises the policy rate, it will raise the inflation target, and vice versa,\ngiven the natural interest rate. If credibility is not perfect or if\nexpectations are not completely rational, the theory needs something more. Here\nI present a model corresponding to this theory that includes both the steady\nstate case and the recovery dynamics after a supply shock, with and without\npolicy reactions to such a shock. But, under the finite horizon assumption for\nIRT, at some future point in time the money supply must become exogenous. This\ncreates the incentive for agents to examine, as of today, statistics on\nmonetary aggregates and form their forecasts of money supply growth and\ninflation rates. Additionally, inflation models of the small open economy allow\nus to deduce that the IRT in this case is much more powerful than otherwise,\nand for the same degree of credibility. But things are not necessarily easier\nfor the monetary authority: it must monitor not only internal indicators, but\nalso external inflation and its determinants, and it must, in certain\ncircumstances, make more intense adjustments to the interest rate.",

Guo\net al.(2011) develop a theoretical structural firm asset value model for a firm\ndefault process that embeds the distinction of these two default times. To be\nmore consistent with the practice, in this paper, we assume the market\nparticipants cannot observe the firm asset value directly and developed a\nreduced-form model to characterize the economic and recorded default times.

        "abstract": "Due to the diversity of fuel cycle simulator modeling assumptions, direct\ncomparison and benchmarking can be difficult. In 2012 the Organisation for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development completed a benchmark study that is\nperhaps the most complete published comparison performed. Despite this, various\nresults from the simulators were often significantly different because of\ninconsistencies in modeling decisions involving reprocessing strategies,\nrefueling behavior, reactor end-of-life handling, etc. This work identifies and\nquantifies the effects of selected modeling choices that may sometimes be taken\nfor granted in the fuel cycle simulation domain. Four scenarios are compared\nusing combinations of fleet-based or individually modeled reactors with monthly\nor quarterly (3-month) time steps. The scenarios approximate a transition from\nthe current U.S. once-through light water reactor fleet to a full sodium fast\nreactor fuel cycle. The Cyclus fuel cycle simulator's plug-in capability along\nwith its market-like dynamic material routing allow it to be used as a level\nplaying field for comparing the scenarios. When under supply-constraint\npressure, the four cases exhibit noticeably different behavior. Fleet-based\nmodeling is more efficient in supply-constrained environments at the expense of\nlosing insight on issues such as realistically suboptimal fuel distribution and\nchallenges in reactor refueling cycle staggering. Finer-grained time steps\nenable more efficient material use in supply-constrained environments resulting\nin lower standing inventories of separated Pu. Large simulations with\nfleet-based reactors run much more quickly than their individual reactor\ncounterparts. Gaining a better understanding of how these and other modeling\nchoices affect fuel cycle dynamics will enable making more deliberate decisions\nwith respect to trade-offs such as computational investment vs. realism.",

        "abstract": "The use of robo-readers to analyze news texts is an emerging technology trend\nin computational finance. In recent research, a substantial effort has been\ninvested to develop sophisticated financial polarity-lexicons that can be used\nto investigate how financial sentiments relate to future company performance.\nHowever, based on experience from other fields, where sentiment analysis is\ncommonly applied, it is well-known that the overall semantic orientation of a\nsentence may differ from the prior polarity of individual words. The objective\nof this article is to investigate how semantic orientations can be better\ndetected in financial and economic news by accommodating the overall\nphrase-structure information and domain-specific use of language. Our three\nmain contributions are: (1) establishment of a human-annotated finance\nphrase-bank, which can be used as benchmark for training and evaluating\nalternative models; (2) presentation of a technique to enhance financial\nlexicons with attributes that help to identify expected direction of events\nthat affect overall sentiment; (3) development of a linearized phrase-structure\nmodel for detecting contextual semantic orientations in financial and economic\nnews texts. The relevance of the newly added lexicon features and the benefit\nof using the proposed learning-algorithm are demonstrated in a comparative\nstudy against previously used general sentiment models as well as the popular\nword frequency models used in recent financial studies.

        "abstract": "In 1979 following a decade of hyperinflation, Iceland introduced\nVer{\\dh}trygg{\\dh} l\\'an, negatively amortised, index-linked loans whose\noutstanding principal is increased by the rate of the consumer price inflation\nindex(CPI). The loans were part of a general government policy which used\nindexation to the CPI to address the economic consequences of the\nhyperinflation. Although most other forms of indexation were subsequently\nremoved, loan indexation has remained, and these loans now comprise the\nmajority of mortgages in Iceland. Although it is still often argued that\nindex-linked loans helped to stop the hyperinflation, these arguments are\ntypically based on high level macro-economic interpretations of the Icelandic\neconomy, they fail to identify specific mechanisms to support their claims. In\nthis paper we take the opposite approach, and present a detailed analysis of\nthe monetary mechanics used for the loans at the double entry bookkeeping level\nof the banking system.\n  Based on this analysis there appears to be no evidence or mechanism that\nwould support the claim that index-linked loans reduce or stop inflation. On\nthe contrary: our research shows that the bookkeeping treatment of these loans\nwithin the banking system directly contributes to the banking system's monetary\nexpansion rate, and hence index-linked loans act to increase the inflation rate\nto which they are linked, rather than reducing it. They consequently create a\npositive feedback loop within the banking system's monetary regulation\noperating directly on the money supply. Since the feedback into monetary\nexpansion only occurs at annual CPI rates above approximately 2%, we suggest\none solution would be to stabilise the money supply to 0% growth, and we\nexplore some ways this could be achieved by modifying the Basel Regulatory\nFramework within the Icelandic Banking System.",

Here we show\nthe effect of speculators on food prices using a validated quantitative model\nthat accurately describes historical food prices. During the last six years,\nhigh and fluctuating food prices have lead to widespread hunger and social\nunrest. While a relative dip in food prices occurred during the spring of 2012,\na massive drought in the American Midwest in June and July threatens to trigger\nanother crisis. In a previous paper, we constructed a model that quantitatively\nagreed with food prices and demonstrated that, while the behavior could not be\nexplained by supply and demand economics, it could be parsimoniously and\naccurately described by a model which included both the conversion of corn into\nethanol and speculator trend following. An update to the original paper in\nFebruary 2012 demonstrated that the model previously published was predictive\nof the ongoing price dynamics, and anticipated a new food crisis by the end of\n2012 if adequate policy actions were not implemented. Here we provide a second\nupdate, evaluating the effects of the current drought on global food prices. We\nfind that the drought may trigger the expected third food price bubble to occur\nsooner, before new limits to speculation are scheduled to take effect. Reducing\nthe amount of corn that is being converted to ethanol may address the immediate\ncrisis. Over the longer term, market stabilization requires limiting financial\nspeculation.",

However, in\nfinancial network models, the details of how financial institutions interact\ntypically play a decisive role, and a general understanding of precisely how\nnetwork topology creates instability remains lacking. Here we show how\nprocesses that are widely believed to stabilise the financial system, i.e.\nmarket integration and diversification, can actually drive it towards\ninstability, as they contribute to create cyclical structures which tend to\namplify financial distress, thereby undermining systemic stability and making\nlarge crises more likely. This result holds irrespective of the details of how\ninstitutions interact, showing that policy-relevant analysis of the factors\naffecting financial stability can be carried out while abstracting away from\nsuch details.",

The\nmodel's fundamental idea is to eliminate risk by hedging the option by\npurchasing and selling the underlying asset in a specific way, that is, to\nreplicate the payoff of the option with a portfolio (which continuously trades\nthe underlying) whose value at each time can be verified. One of the most\ncrucial, yet restrictive, assumptions for this task is that the market follows\na geometric Brownian motion, which has been relaxed and generalized in various\nways.\n  The concept of robust finance revolves around developing models that account\nfor uncertainties and variations in financial markets. Martingale Optimal\nTransport, which is an adaptation of the Optimal Transport theory to the robust\nfinancial framework, is one of the most prominent directions. In this paper, we\nconsider market models with arbitrarily many underlying assets whose values are\nobserved over arbitrarily many time periods, and demonstrates the existence of\na portfolio sub- or super-hedging a general path-dependent derivative security\nin terms of trading European options and underlyings, as well as the portfolio\nreplicating the derivative payoff when the market model yields the extremal\nprice of the derivative given marginal distributions of the underlyings.

These crisis resolutions are often accompanied by austerity programs\ncausing political and social friction on both domestic and international\nlevels. The question of how to resolve failing financial institutions under\nwhich economic preconditions is therefore a pressing and controversial issue of\nvast political importance. In this work we employ an agent-based model to study\nthe economic and financial ramifications of three highly relevant crisis\nresolution mechanisms. To establish the validity of the model we show that it\nreproduces a series of key stylized facts if the financial and real economy.\nThe distressed institution can either be closed via a purchase & assumption\ntransaction, it can be bailed-out using taxpayer money, or it may be bailed-in\nin a debt-to-equity conversion. We find that for an economy characterized by\nlow unemployment and high productivity the optimal crisis resolution with\nrespect to financial stability and economic productivity is to close the\ndistressed institution.

        "abstract": "We propose a unified structural credit risk model incorporating both\ninsolvency and illiquidity risks, in order to investigate how a firm's default\nprobability depends on the liquidity risk associated with its financing\nstructure. We assume the firm finances its risky assets by mainly issuing\nshort- and long-term debt. Short-term debt can have either a discrete or a more\nrealistic staggered tenor structure. At rollover dates of short-term debt,\ncreditors face a dynamic coordination problem. We show that a unique threshold\nstrategy (i.e., a debt run barrier) exists for short-term creditors to decide\nwhen to withdraw their funding, and this strategy is closely related to the\nsolution of a non-standard optimal stopping time problem with control\nconstraints. We decompose the total credit risk into an insolvency component\nand an illiquidity component based on such an endogenous debt run barrier\ntogether with an exogenous insolvency barrier.",

        "abstract": "Prediction of events in financial markets is every investor's dream and,\nusually, wishful thinking. From a more general, economic and societal\nviewpoint, the identification of indicators for large events is highly\ndesirable to assess systemic risks. Unfortunately, the very nature of financial\nmarkets, particularly the predominantly non-Markovian character as well as\nnon-stationarity, make this challenge a formidable one, leaving little hope for\nfully fledged answers. Nevertheless, it is called for to collect pieces of\nevidence in a variety of observables to be assembled like the pieces of a\npuzzle that eventually might help to catch a glimpse of long-term indicators or\nprecursors for large events - if at all in a statistical sense. Here, we\npresent a new piece for this puzzle. We use the quasi-stationary market states\nwhich exist in the time evolution of the correlation structure in financial\nmarkets. Recently, we identified such market states relative to the collective\nmotion of the market as a whole. We study their precursor properties in the US\nstock markets over 16 years, including two endogenous crises, the dot-com\nbubble burst and the pre-phase of the Lehman Brothers crash. We identify\ncertain interesting features and critically discuss their suitability as\nindicators.",

        "abstract": "Supply chains lend themselves to blockchain technology, but certain\nchallenges remain, especially around invoice financing. For example, the\nfurther a supplier is removed from the final consumer product, the more\ndifficult it is to get their invoices financed. Moreover, for competitive\nreasons, retailers and manufacturers do not want to disclose their supply\nchains. However, upstream suppliers need to prove that they are part of a\n`stable' supply chain to get their invoices financed, which presents the\nupstream suppliers with huge, and often unsurmountable, obstacles to get the\nnecessary finance to fulfil the next order, or to expand their business. Using\na fictitious supply chain use case, which is based on a real world use case, we\ndemonstrate how these challenges have the potential to be solved by combining\nmore advanced and specialised blockchain technologies with other technologies\nsuch as Artificial Intelligence. We describe how atomic crosschain\nfunctionality can be utilised across private blockchains to retrieve the\ninformation required for an invoice financier to make informed decisions under\nuncertainty, and consider the effect this decision has on the overall stability\nof the supply chain.",

However, the evolution of the client's habits in modern societies and\nthe recent European regulations promoting more competition mean the retail\nbanks will encounter serious challenges for the next few years, endangering\ntheir activities. They now face an impossible compromise: maximizing the\nsatisfaction of their hyper-connected clients while avoiding any risk of\ndefault and being regulatory compliant. Therefore, advanced and novel research\nconcepts are a serious game-changer to gain a competitive advantage. In this\ncontext, we investigate in this thesis different concepts bridging the gap\nbetween persistent homology, neural networks, recommender engines and\nreinforcement learning with the aim of improving the quality of the retail\nbanking services. Our contribution is threefold. First, we highlight how to\novercome insufficient financial data by generating artificial data using\ngenerative models and persistent homology. Then, we present how to perform\naccurate financial recommendations in multi-dimensions. Finally, we underline a\nreinforcement learning model-free approach to determine the optimal policy of\nmoney management based on the aggregated financial transactions of the clients.\nOur experimental data sets, extracted from well-known institutions where the\nprivacy and the confidentiality of the clients were not put at risk, support\nour contributions.

Measured by the expected loss under the worst-case scenario,\nfinancial risk caused by model uncertainty is regarded as a result of the\ninteraction between financial market and external information sources. This\nforms a thermodynamic picture in which a closed system interacts with an\nexternal reservoir, reaching its equilibrium at the worst-case scenario. The\nseverity of the worst-case scenario depends on the rate of heat dissipation,\ncaused by information sources reducing the entropy of the system. This\nthermodynamic picture leads to simple and natural derivation of the\ncharacterization rules of the worst-case risk, and gives its Lagrangian and\nHamiltonian forms. With its help financial practitioners may evaluate risks\nutilizing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.",

The four US asset indices investigated were: (1) US National\nProperty index; (2) Russell 2000 index; (3) S&P 500 index; and (4) NASDAQ\nindex. Notwithstanding the financial crisis of 2007-2008, US real GDP increased\nexponentially over the period 2001 to 2019, with an average annual growth rate\nof approximately 2%. However, over this time period, the average annual rate of\ngrowth of US GDP was considerably lower than the average annual rate of growth\nof the US broad money supply (5.7%). The main determinant of the average growth\nrate for all four US asset indices studied would appear to be the growth rate\nin the US broad money supply. In addition, the growth rate in the US Russell\n2000 stock index and the NASDAQ index would appear to be a function of the\ncombined positive effects of both the growth rate in the US Broad Money Supply\nand the growth rate of US GDP.",

The allocation of factors is\nsubjected to the dualistic regulation of planning or administration and market\ndue to the dualistic system, and thus the signal distortion will be a commonly\nseen existence. From the perspective of balanced and safe growth, the\ninstitutional distortions of population birth, population flow, land\ntransaction and housing supply, with the changing of export, may cause great\ninfluences on the production demand, which includes the iterative contraction\nof consumption, the increase of export competitive cost, the widening of\nurban-rural income gap, the transferring of residents' income and the crowding\nout of consumption. In view of the worldwide shift from a conservative model\nwith more income than expenditure to the debt-based model with more expenditure\nthan income and the need for loose monetary policy, we must explore a basic\nmodel that includes variables of debt and land assets that affecting money\nsupply and price changes, especially in China, where the current debt ratio is\nhigh and is likely to rise continuously.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a deep neural network approach to solve a lifetime\nexpected mortality-weighted utility-based model for optimal consumption in the\ndecumulation phase of a defined contribution pension system. We formulate this\nproblem as a multi-period finite-horizon stochastic control problem and train a\ndeep neural network policy representing consumption decisions. The optimal\nconsumption policy is determined by personal information about the retiree such\nas age, wealth, risk aversion and bequest motive, as well as a series of\neconomic and financial variables including inflation rates and asset returns\njointly simulated from a proposed seven-factor economic scenario generator\ncalibrated from market data. We use the Australian pension system as an\nexample, with consideration of the government-funded means-tested Age Pension\nand other practical aspects such as fund management fees. The key findings from\nour numerical tests are as follows. First, our deep neural network optimal\nconsumption policy, which adapts to changes in market conditions, outperforms\ndeterministic drawdown rules proposed in the literature. Moreover, the\nout-of-sample outperformance ratios increase as the number of training\niterations increases, eventually reaching outperformance on all testing\nscenarios after less than 10 minutes of training. Second, a sensitivity\nanalysis is performed to reveal how risk aversion and bequest motives change\nthe consumption over a retiree's lifetime under this utility framework. Third,\nwe provide the optimal consumption rate with different starting wealth\nbalances. We observe that optimal consumption rates are not proportional to\ninitial wealth due to the Age Pension payment. Forth, with the same initial\nwealth balance and utility parameter settings, the optimal consumption level is\ndifferent between males and females due to gender differences in mortality.",

        "Published: ": "2019-09-19T21:18:48Z",
        "abstract": "This systemic risk paper introduces inhomogeneous random financial networks\n(IRFNs). Such models are intended to describe parts, or the entirety, of a\nhighly heterogeneous network of banks and their interconnections, in the global\nfinancial system. Both the balance sheets and the stylized crisis behaviour of\nbanks are ingredients of the network model. A systemic crisis is pictured as\ntriggered by a shock to banks' balance sheets, which then leads to the\npropagation of damaging shocks and the potential for amplification of the\ncrisis, ending with the system in a cascade equilibrium. Under some conditions\nthe model has ``locally tree-like independence (LTI)'', where a general\npercolation theoretic argument leads to an analytic fixed point equation\ndescribing the cascade equilibrium when the number of banks $N$ in the system\nis taken to infinity. This paper focusses on mathematical properties of the\nframework in the context of Eisenberg-Noe solvency cascades generalized to\naccount for fractional bankruptcy charges. New results including a definition\nand proof of the ``LTI property'' of the Eisenberg-Noe solvency cascade\nmechanism lead to explicit $N=\\infty$ fixed point equations that arise under\nvery general model specifications. The essential formulas are shown to be\nimplementable via well-defined approximation schemes, but numerical exploration\nof some of the wide range of potential applications of the method is left for\nfuture work.",

        "abstract": "The latest global financial tsunami and its follow-up global economic\nrecession has uncovered the crucial impact of housing markets on financial and\neconomic systems. The Chinese stock market experienced a markedly fall during\nthe global financial tsunami and China's economy has also slowed down by about\n2\\%-3\\% when measured in GDP. Nevertheless, the housing markets in diverse\nChinese cities seemed to continue the almost nonstop mania for more than ten\nyears. However, the structure and dynamics of the Chinese housing market are\nless studied. Here we perform an extensive study of the Chinese housing market\nby analyzing ten representative key cities based on both linear and nonlinear\neconophysical and econometric methods. We identify a common collective driving\nforce which accounts for 96.5\\% of the house price growth, indicating very high\nsystemic risk in the Chinese housing market. The ten key cities can be\ncategorized into clubs and the house prices of the cities in the same club\nexhibit an evident convergence. These findings from different methods are\nbasically consistent with each other. The identified city clubs are also\nconsistent with the conventional classification of city tiers. The house prices\nof the first-tier cities grow the fastest, and those of the third- and\nfourth-tier cities rise the slowest, which illustrates the possible presence of\na ripple effect in the diffusion of house prices in different cities.",

Our major finding is that provided\nits policy is not too aggressive (in a sense detailed in the paper) the Central\nBank is successful in achieving its goals. However, the existence of different\nequilibrium states of the economy, separated by phase boundaries (or \"dark\ncorners\"), can cause the monetary policy itself to trigger instabilities and be\ncounter-productive.

Monte Carlo\nexperiments demonstrate the vast superiority of non-quadratic global hedging as\nit results simultaneously in downside risk metrics two to three times smaller\nthan best benchmarks and in significant hedging gains. Analyses show that the\nneural networks are able to effectively adapt their hedging decisions to\ndifferent penalties and stylized facts of risky asset dynamics only by\nexperiencing simulations of the financial market exhibiting these features.\nNumerical results also indicate that non-quadratic global policies are\nsignificantly more geared towards being long equity risk which entails earning\nthe equity risk premium.",

This scheme uses distributed consensus to realize data\nsecurity, traceability, and immutability. We also use smart contracts to define\nsystem processes and access policies to ensure the efficient operation of the\nsystem. To verify the performance of Fabric-SCF, we designed two sets of\nsimulation experiments. The results show that Fabric-SCF achieves dynamic and\nfine-grained access control while maintaining high throughput in a simulated\nreal-world operating scenario.",

        "abstract": "This study examines how housing sector volatilities affect real estate\ninvestment trust (REIT) equity return in the United States. I argue that\nunexpected changes in housing variables can be a source of aggregate housing\nrisk, and the first principal component extracted from the volatilities of U.S.\nhousing variables can predict the expected REIT equity returns. I propose and\nconstruct a factor-based housing risk index as an additional factor in asset\nprice models that uses the time-varying conditional volatility of housing\nvariables within the U.S. housing sector. The findings show that the proposed\nhousing risk index is economically and theoretically consistent with the\nrisk-return relationship of the conditional Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing\nModel (ICAPM) of Merton (1973), which predicts an average maximum of 5.6\npercent of risk premium in REIT equity return. In subsample analyses, the\npositive relationship is not affected by sample periods' choice but shows\nhigher housing risk beta values for the 2009-18 sample period. The relationship\nremains significant after controlling for VIX, Fama-French three factors, and a\nbroad set of macroeconomic and financial variables. Moreover, the proposed\nhousing beta also accurately forecasts U.S. macroeconomic and financial\nconditions.",

In our work, a real options valuation\n(ROV) framework is proposed to determine the optimal strategy for executing\nmultiple interacting options within a distribution network investment, to\nmitigate the risk of financial losses in the presence of future uncertainties.\nTo demonstrate the characteristics of the proposed framework, we determine the\noptimal strategy to economically justify the investment in residential\nPV-battery systems for additional grid supply during peak demand periods. The\noptions to defer, and then expand, are considered as multi-stage compound\noptions, since the option to expand is a subsequent option of the former. These\noptions are valued via the least squares Monte Carlo method, incorporating\nuncertainty over growing power demand, varying diesel fuel price, and the\ndeclining cost of PV-battery technology as random variables. Finally, a\nsensitivity analysis is performed to demonstrate how the proposed framework\nresponds to uncertain events. The proposed framework shows that executing the\ninteracting options at the optimal timing increases the investment value.",

Using\ninsights on the behavior of multiplicative stochastic processes, we demonstrate\nthat the tails of the unconditional distribution emerging from such bubble\nprocesses follow power-laws (exhibit hyperbolic decline). More precisely, we\nfind that rational bubbles predict a 'fat' power tail for both the bubble\ncomponent and price differences with an exponent smaller than 1, implying\nabsence of convergence of the mean. The distribution of returns is dominated by\nthe same power-law over an extended range of large returns. Although power-law\ntails are a pervasive feature of empirical data, these numerical predictions\nare in disagreement with the usual empirical estimates of an exponent between 2\nand 4.

In\nthis paper, we first extend their idea to a regime-switching framework in which\nthe expected return of the risky asset and its volatility depend on an\nunobservable Markovian term which describes the cyclical nature of asset\nreturns in modern financial markets. We then analyze and compare the resulting\nVaR-based portfolio insurance (VBPI) strategy with the well-known constant\nproportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) strategy. In this respect, we employ a\nvariety of performance evaluation criteria such as Sharpe, Omega and Kappa\nratios to compare the two methods.

This is a subject\nof growing importance in modern UK society with the withdrawal of cash\ninfrastructure and a shift towards online banking. This research develops a\ncomposite indicator using a wide-range of input variables, including the\nlocations of existing cash infrastructure, various demographic factors (such as\nincome and housing tenure) and other freely available lifestyle data to\nidentify areas at greatest risk of financial exclusion, thereby aiding\norganisations to develop intervention strategies to tackle the problem. The\nindicator illustrates that whilst there is no apparent correlation between\nfinancial exclusion and deprivation, pockets of extreme financial exclusion are\ngenerally found in deprived communities, and affluent, suburban areas tend to\nscore consistently more favourably and consequently carry less risk. The\nattributing causes vary, from a lack of infrastructure, to low car\navailability, but income levels have a pronounced influence. Three policy\nproposals are put forward, including offering banking services at PayPoint\noutlets, and converting cash machines to cash recyclers, but improving digital\nadoption was found to be the most effective intervention, provided that it is\nimplemented by community organisations. Policies purely targeting\ninfrastructure provision or addressing social exclusion are unlikely to be\neffective, as community-based initiatives coupled with wider reforms to the\nfinancial system are needed.",

        "abstract": "The modeling of financial markets as disequilibrium models by ordinary\ndifferential equations has become a popular modeling tool. One famous example\nof such a model is the Beja-Goldman model(The Journal of Finance, 1980) which\nwe consider in this paper. We study the passage from disequilibrium dynamics to\nequilibrium. Mathematically, this limit corresponds to an asymptotic limit also\nknown as a Tikhonov-Fenichel reduction. Furthermore, we analyze the stability\nof the reduced equilibrium model and discuss the economic implications. We\nconduct several numerical examples to visualize and support our analysis.",

We show\nthat, depending on the model parameters, four qualitatively different outcomes\ncan emerge, characterised by the frequency of capital scarcity and/or demand\ncrises. In the absence of policy measures, the duration of such crises can\nincrease by orders of magnitude when parameters are varied, as a result of the\n\"paradox of thrift\".

We\ncombine our findings with learnings from classical monetary policy, resulting\nin a comprehensive taxonomy of cryptocurrency stabilization. We use our\ntaxonomy to highlight the current state of development from different\nperspectives and show blank spots.

Our taxonomy bridges computer science and economics,\nfostering the transfer of expertise.

Here we address the more\ngeneral problem of how shock propagation dynamics depends on the topological\ndetails of the underlying network. To this end we consider different realistic\nnetwork topologies, all consistent with balance sheets information obtained\nfrom real data on financial institutions. In particular, we consider networks\nof varying density and with different block structures, and diversify as well\nin the details of the shock propagation dynamics.

        "abstract": "XVAs denote various counterparty risk related valuation adjustments that are\napplied to financial derivatives since the 2007--09 crisis. We root a\ncost-of-capital XVA strategy in a balance sheet perspective which is key in\nidentifying the economic meaning of the XVA terms. Our approach is first\ndetailed in a static setup that is solved explicitly. It is then plugged in the\ndynamic and trade incremental context of a real derivative banking portfolio.\nThe corresponding cost-of-capital XVA strategy ensures to bank shareholders a\nsubmartingale equity process corresponding to a target hurdle rate on their\ncapital at risk, consistently between and throughout deals. Set on a\nforward/backward SDE formulation, this strategy can be solved efficiently using\nGPU computing combined with deep learning regression methods in a whole bank\nbalance sheet context. A numerical case study emphasizes the workability and\nadded value of the ensuing pathwise XVA computations.",

In this paper,\nwe document an increase in the regulatory energy per filing, i.e., a warming\n\"temperature.\" We also find that the diversity of the regulatory ecosystem has\nbeen increasing over the past two decades, as measured by the dimensionality of\nthe regulatory space and distance between the \"regulatory bitstrings\" of\ncompanies. These findings support the claim that regulatory activity and\ncomplexity are increasing, and this measurement framework contributes an\nimportant step towards improving academic and policy discussions around legal\ncomplexity and regulation.",

To robustify\noptimal policies against model uncertainty, we assess a policy not by its\ndistribution, but rather, by the worst possible distribution that lies within a\nWasserstein ball around it. Thus, our problem formulation may be viewed as an\nactor/agent choosing a policy (the outer problem), and the adversary then\nacting to worsen the performance of that strategy (the inner problem).

It is quite\ndifferent in the Solvency 2 framework because the target capital has to control\nthe global risk of the company. And the financial risk takes part of this\nglobal risk. Thus the economic equities maximization criterion leads to search\na couple asset allocation / equities which solves a stochastic program. A\nnumerical illustration makes it possible to analyze the consequences of the\nintroduction of a Solvency 2 framework on the technical reserves and the\nequities of a non-life insurance company and on the optimal allocation due to\nthe economic equities maximization criterion. Finally, the impact of a\nmisspecification of the risky asset model on the optimal allocation is\nillustrated.",

        "abstract": "Green ammonia is poised to be a key part in the hydrogen economy. This paper\ndiscusses green ammonia supply chains from a higher-level industry perspective\nwith a focus on market structures. The architecture of upstream and downstream\nsupply chains are explored. Potential ways to accelerate market emergence are\ndiscussed. Market structure is explored based on transaction cost economics and\nlessons from the oil and gas industry. Three market structure prototypes are\ndeveloped for different phases. In the infancy, a highly vertically integrated\nstructure is proposed to reduce risks and ensure capital recovery. A\nrestructuring towards a disintegrated structure is necessary in the next stage\nto improve the efficiency. In the late stage, a competitive structure\ncharacterized by a separation between asset ownership and production activities\nand further development of short-term and spot markets is proposed towards a\nmarket-driven industry. Finally, a multi-linear regression model is developed\nto evaluate the developed structures using a case in the gas industry. Results\nindicate that high asset specificity and uncertainty and low frequency lead to\na more disintegrated market structure, and vice versa, thus supporting the\nstructures designed. We assume the findings and results contribute to\ndeveloping green ammonia supply chains and the hydrogen economy.",

The temporal scales of the dynamics of the financial\nvariables and the macroeconomic fundamentals are very different, which make the\nempirical linkage even more interesting and significant. Also, we find that\nthere exist in the respective networks, core-periphery structures (determined\nthrough centrality measures) that are composed of the similar set of countries\n-- a result that may be related through the `gravity model' of the\ncountry-level macroeconomic networks. Thus, from a multi-lateral openness\nperspective, we elucidate that for individual countries, larger trade\nconnectivity is positively associated with higher financial return\ncorrelations. Furthermore, we show that the Economic Complexity Index and the\nequity markets have a positive relationship among themselves, as is the case\nfor Gross Domestic Product. The data science methodology using network theory,\ncoupled with standard econometric techniques constitute a new approach to\nstudying multi-level economic phenomena in a comprehensive manner.",

We study two implied parameters: the\nimplied volatility and the implied average cumulative risk free interest rate.\nThey can be found unconditionally from a system of two equations.

However,\nmost existing studies focus on the supply side perspective, disregarding the\nimpact of customer choice behavior in the presence of co-existing transport\nnetworks. We propose a modeling framework for dynamic integrated\nmobility-on-demand service operation policy evaluation with two service\noptions: door-to-door rideshare and rideshare with transit transfer. A new\nconstrained dynamic pricing model is proposed to maximize operator profit,\ntaking into account the correlated structure of different modes of transport.\nUser willingness to pay is considered as a stochastic constraint, resulting in\na more realistic ticket price setting while maximizing operator profit. Unlike\nmost studies, which assume that travel demand is known, we propose a demand\nlearning process to calibrate customer demand over time based on customers'\nhistorical purchase data. We evaluate the proposed methodology through\nsimulations under different scenarios on a test network by considering the\ninteractions of supply and demand in a multimodal market. Different scenarios\nin terms of customer arrival intensity, vehicle capacity, and the variance of\nuser willingness to pay are tested. Results suggest that the proposed\nchance-constrained assortment price optimization model allows increasing\noperator profit while keeping the proposed ticket prices acceptable.",

The market interpretation allows us to establish\nfundamental properties that explain how physical resources (primal variables)\nand associated economic values (dual variables) flow in the SC. We use duality\ntheory to explain why incentivizing markets by forcing stakeholder\nparticipation (e.g., by imposing demand satisfaction or service provision\nconstraints) yields artificial price behavior, inefficient allocations, and\neconomic losses. To overcome these issues, we explore market incentive\nmechanisms that use bids; here, we introduce the concept of a stakeholder graph\n(a product-based representation of a supply chain) and show that this\nrepresentation allows us to naturally determine minimum bids that activate the\nmarket. These results provide guidelines to design SC formulations that\nproperly remunerate stakeholders and to design policy that foster market\ntransactions.

        "abstract": "Risk and uncertainty in each stage of CLSC have greatly increased the\ncomplexity and reduced process efficiency of the closed-loop networks, impeding\nthe sustainable and resilient development of industries and the circular\neconomy. Recently, increasing interest in academia have been raised on the risk\nand uncertainty analysis of closed-loop supply chain, yet there is no\ncomprehensive review paper focusing on closed-loop network design considering\nrisk and uncertainty. This paper examines previous research on the domain of\nclosed-loop network design under risk and uncertainties to provide constructive\nprospects for future study. We selected 106 papers published in the Scopus\ndatabase from the year 2004 to 2022. We analyse the source of risk and\nuncertainties of the CLSC network and identified appropriate methods for\nhandling uncertainties in addition to algorithms for solving uncertain CLSCND\nproblems. We also illustrate the evolution of objectives for designing a\nclosed-loop supply chain that is expos to risk or uncertainty, and investigate\nthe application of uncertain network design models in practical industry\nsectors. Finally, we draw proper research gaps for each category and clarify\nsome novel insights for future study. By considering the impacts of risk or\nuncertainties of different sources on closed-loop supply chain network design,\nwe can approach the economical, sustainable, social, and resilient objectives\neffectively and efficiently.",

        "abstract": "Monitoring the money supply is an important prerequisite for conducting sound\nmonetary policy, yet monetary indicators are conventionally estimated in\naggregate. This paper proposes a new methodology that is able to leverage\nmicro-level transaction data from real-world payment systems. We apply a novel\ncomputational technique to measure the durations for which money is held in\nindividual accounts, and compute the transfer velocity of money from its\ninverse. Our new definition reduces to existing definitions under conventional\nassumptions. However, inverse estimation remains suitable for payment systems\nwhere the total balance fluctuates and spending patterns change in time. Our\nmethod is applied to study Sarafu, a small digital community currency in Kenya,\nwhere transaction data is available from 25 January 2020 to 15 June 2021. We\nfind that the transfer velocity of Sarafu was higher than it would seem, in\naggregate, because not all units of Sarafu remained in active circulation.\nMoreover, inverse estimation reveals strong heterogineities and enables\ncomparisons across subgroups of spenders. Some units of Sarafu were held for\nminutes, others for months, and spending patterns differed across communities\nusing Sarafu. The rate of circulation and the effective balance of Sarafu\nchanged substantially over time, as these communities experienced economic\ndisruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal food insecurity.\nThese findings contribute to a growing body of literature documenting the\nheterogeneous patterns underlying headline macroeconomic indicators and their\nrelevance for policy. Inverse estimation may be especially useful in studying\nthe response of spenders to targeted monetary operations.",

However,\nin financial markets, we often observe that financial volatility processes\ndepend on economic states, so they have a state heterogeneous structure. In\nthis paper, to study state heterogeneous market dynamics based on\nhigh-frequency data, we introduce a novel volatility model based on a\ncontinuous Ito diffusion process whose intraday instantaneous volatility\nprocess evolves depending on the exogenous state variable, as well as its\nintegrated volatility. We call it the state heterogeneous GARCH-Ito (SG-Ito)\nmodel. We suggest a quasi-likelihood estimation procedure with the realized\nvolatility proxy and establish its asymptotic behaviors. Moreover, to test the\nlow-frequency state heterogeneity, we develop a Wald test-type hypothesis\ntesting procedure. The results of empirical studies suggest the existence of\nleverage, investor attention, market illiquidity, stock market comovement, and\npost-holiday effect in S&P 500 index volatility.",

Abundance of the empirical data as well as general insights into\nthe trading behavior enables the creation of simple agent-based models\nreproducing sophisticated statistical features of the financial markets. In\nthis contribution we consider a possibility to prevent self-organized extreme\nevents in artificial financial market setup built upon a simple agent-based\nherding model. We show that introduction of agents with predefined\nfundamentalist trading behavior helps to significantly reduce the probability\nof the extreme price fluctuations events. We also test random trading control\nstrategy, which was previously found to be promising, and find that its impact\non the market is rather ambiguous.

        "abstract": "We study a novel economic network (supply chain) comprised of wire transfers\n(electronic payment transactions) among the universe of firms in Brazil (6.2\nmillion firms). We construct a directed and weighted network in which vertices\nrepresent cities and edges connote pairwise economic dependence between cities.\nCities (vertices) represent the collection of all firms in that location and\nlinks denote intercity wire transfers. We find a high degree of economic\nintegration among cities in the trade network, which is consistent with the\nhigh degree of specialization found across Brazilian cities. We are able to\nidentify which cities have a dominant role in the entire supply chain process\nusing centrality network measures. We find that the trade network has a\ndisassortative mixing pattern, which is consistent with the power-law shape of\nthe firm size distribution in Brazil. After the Brazilian recession in 2014, we\nfind that the disassortativity becomes even stronger as a result of the death\nof many small firms and the consequent concentration of economic flows on large\nfirms. Our results suggest that recessions have a large impact on the trade\nnetwork with meaningful and heterogeneous economic consequences across\nmunicipalities. We run econometric exercises and find that courts efficiency\nplays a dual role. From the customer perspective, it plays an important role in\nreducing contractual frictions as it increases economic transactions between\ndifferent cities. From the supplier perspective, cities that are central\nsuppliers to the supply chain seem to use courts inefficiency as a lawsuit\nbarrier from their customers.",

Recent work has introduced to this model a class\nof obligations called credit default swaps, a certain kind of financial\nderivatives. The main computational challenge for such systems is known as the\nclearing problem, which is to determine which firms are in default and to\ncompute their exposure to systemic risk, technically known as their recovery\nrates. It is known that the recovery rates form the set of fixed points of a\nsimple function, and that these fixed points can be irrational. Furthermore,\nSchuldenzucker et al. (2016) have shown that finding a weakly (or \"almost\")\napproximate (rational) fixed point is PPAD-complete. We further study the\nclearing problem from the point of view of irrationality and approximation\nstrength. Firstly, we observe that weakly approximate solutions may\nmisrepresent the actual financial state of an institution. On this basis, we\nstudy the complexity of finding a strongly (or \"near\") approximate solution,\nand show FIXP-completeness. We then study the structural properties required\nfor irrationality, and we give necessary conditions for irrational solutions to\nemerge: The presence of certain types of cycles in a financial network forces\nthe recovery rates to take the form of roots of non-linear polynomials. In the\nabsence of a large subclass of such cycles, we study the complexity of finding\nan exact fixed point, which we show to be a problem close to, albeit outside\nof, PPAD.",

        "abstract": "This research paper provides a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin, delving\ninto its evolution, adoption, and potential future implications. As the\npioneering cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has sparked significant interest and debate\nin recent years, challenging traditional financial systems and introducing the\nworld to the power of blockchain technology. This paper aims to offer a\nthorough understanding of Bitcoin's underlying cryptographic principles,\nnetwork architecture, and consensus mechanisms, primarily focusing on the\nProof-of-Work model.\n  We also explore the economic aspects of Bitcoin, examining price\nfluctuations, market trends, and factors influencing its value. A detailed\ninvestigation of the regulatory landscape, including global regulatory\napproaches, taxation policies, and legal challenges, offers insights into the\nhurdles and opportunities faced by the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, we discuss\nthe adoption of Bitcoin in various use cases, its impact on traditional\nfinance, and its role in the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n  Finally, the paper addresses the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,\nidentifying emerging trends, technological innovations, and environmental\nconcerns. We evaluate the potential impact of central bank digital currencies\n(CBDCs) on Bitcoin's future, as well as the broader implications of this\ntechnology on global finance. By providing a holistic understanding of\nBitcoin's past, present, and potential future, this paper aims to serve as a\nvaluable resource for scholars, policymakers, and enthusiasts alike.",

        "Published: ": "2020-06-20T00:22:49Z",
        "abstract": "Over the last couple of decades in the lending industry, financial\ndisintermediation has occurred on a global scale. Traditionally, even for small\nsupply of funds, banks would act as the conduit between the funds and the\nborrowers. It has now been possible to overcome some of the obstacles\nassociated with such supply of funds with the advent of online platforms like\nKiva, Prosper, LendingClub. Kiva for example, works with Micro Finance\nInstitutions (MFIs) in developing countries to build Internet profiles of\nborrowers with a brief biography, loan requested, loan term, and purpose. Kiva,\nin particular, allows lenders to fund projects in different sectors through\ngroup or individual funding. Traditional research studies have investigated\nvarious factors behind lender preferences purely from the perspective of loan\nattributes and only until recently have some cross-country cultural preferences\nbeen investigated. In this paper, we investigate lender perceptions of economic\nfactors of the borrower countries in relation to their preferences towards\nloans associated with different sectors. We find that the influence from\neconomic factors and loan attributes can have substantially different roles to\nplay for different sectors in achieving faster funding. We formally investigate\nand quantify the hidden biases prevalent in different loan sectors using recent\ntools from causal inference and regression models that rely on Bayesian\nvariable selection methods. We then extend these models to incorporate fairness\nconstraints based on our empirical analysis and find that such models can still\nachieve near comparable results with respect to baseline regression models.",

        "abstract": "Cities are the drivers of socio-economic innovation, and are also forced to\naddress the accelerating risk of failure in providing essential services such\nas water supply today and in the future. Here, we investigate the resilience of\nurban water supply security, which is defined in terms of the services that\ncitizens receive. The resilience of services is determined by the availability\nand robustness of critical system elements, or 'capitals' (water resources,\ninfrastructure, finances, management efficacy and community adaptation). We\ntranslate quantitative information about this portfolio of capitals from seven\ncontrasting cities on four continents into parameters of a coupled systems\ndynamics model. Water services are disrupted by recurring stochastic shocks,\nand we simulate the dynamics of impact and recovery cycles. Resilience emerges\nunder various constraints, expressed in terms of each city's capital portfolio.\nSystematic assessment of the parameter space produces the urban water\nresilience landscape, and we determine the position of each city along a\ncontinuous gradient from water insecure and non-resilient to secure and\nresilient systems. In several cities stochastic disturbance regimes challenge\nsteady-state conditions and drive system collapse. While water insecure and\nnon-resilient cities risk being pushed into a poverty trap, cities which have\ndeveloped excess capitals risk being trapped in rigidity and crossing a tipping\npoint from high to low services and collapse. Where public services are\ninsufficient, community adaptation improves water security and resilience to\nvarying degrees. Our results highlight the need for resilience thinking in the\ngovernance of urban water systems under global change pressures.",

        "abstract": "Time series forecasting is essential for decision making in many domains. In\nthis work, we address the challenge of predicting prices evolution among\nmultiple potentially interacting financial assets. A solution to this problem\nhas obvious importance for governments, banks, and investors. Statistical\nmethods such as Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) are widely\napplied to these problems. In this paper, we propose to approach economic time\nseries forecasting of multiple financial assets in a novel way via video\nprediction. Given past prices of multiple potentially interacting financial\nassets, we aim to predict the prices evolution in the future. Instead of\ntreating the snapshot of prices at each time point as a vector, we spatially\nlayout these prices in 2D as an image, such that we can harness the power of\nCNNs in learning a latent representation for these financial assets. Thus, the\nhistory of these prices becomes a sequence of images, and our goal becomes\npredicting future images. We build on a state-of-the-art video prediction\nmethod for forecasting future images. Our experiments involve the prediction\ntask of the price evolution of nine financial assets traded in U.S. stock\nmarkets. The proposed method outperforms baselines including ARIMA, Prophet,\nand variations of the proposed method, demonstrating the benefits of harnessing\nthe power of CNNs in the problem of economic time series forecasting.",

We establish the\ntheoretical relationship between the level of balance in a network and stock\npredictability, studying its evolution from 2005 to the third quarter of 2020.\nWe find a clear balance-unbalance transition for six of the nine countries,\nfollowing the August 2011 Black Monday in the US, when the Economic Policy\nUncertainty index for this country reached its highest monthly level before the\nCOVID-19 crisis. This sudden loss of balance is mainly caused by a\nreorganization of the market networks triggered by a group of low\ncapitalization stocks belonging to the non-financial sector. After the\ntransition, the stocks of companies in these groups become all negatively\ncorrelated between them and with most of the rest of the stocks in the market.\nThe implied change in the network topology is directly related to a decrease in\nstocks predictability, a finding with novel important implications for asset\nallocation and portfolio hedging strategies.",

In the framework\nof Debt Rank algorithm, we introduce an approximate method of systemic risk\nevaluation which requires only node properties, such as total assets and\nliabilities, as inputs. We demonstrate that this approximation captures a large\nportion of systemic risk measured by Debt Rank. Furthermore, using Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we investigate network structures that can amplify systemic risk.\nIndeed, while no topology in general sense is {\\em a priori} more stable if the\nmarket is liquid [1], a larger complexity is detrimental for the overall\nstability [2]. Here we find that the measure of scalar assortativity correlates\nwell with level of systemic risk. In particular, network structures with high\nsystemic risk are scalar assortative, meaning that risky banks are mostly\nexposed to other risky banks. Network structures with low systemic risk are\nscalar disassortative, with interactions of risky banks with stable banks.",

Two main aspects are\nconsidered: how the financial risk is distributed among the European countries\nand how large is the value of the total risk. The first aspect is evaluated by\nmeans of the expected value of a dynamic entropy measure. The second one is\nsolved by computing the evolution of the total credit spread over time.\nMoreover, the covariance between countries' total spread allows understand any\ncontagions in EU. The methodology is applied to real data of 24 countries for\nthe three major agencies: Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch.

The likely\norganizational behavior could be the one that remains most robust against\nmonetary flow equilibration as an agency of applying perturbations.",

        "Published: ": "2018-11-06T14:45:37Z",
        "abstract": "Energy markets are strategic to governments and economic development. Several\ncommodities compete as substitutable energy sources and energy diversifiers.\nSuch competition reduces the energy vulnerability of countries as well as\nportfolios' risk exposure. Vulnerability results mainly from price trends and\nfluctuations, following supply and demand shocks. Such energy price uncertainty\nattracts many market participants in the energy commodity markets. First,\nenergy producers and consumers hedge adverse price changes with energy\nderivatives. Second, financial market participants use commodities and\ncommodity derivatives to diversify their conventional portfolios. For that\nreason, we consider the joint dependence between the United States (U.S.)\nnatural gas, crude oil and stock markets. We use Gatfaoui's (2015) time varying\nmultivariate copula analysis and related variance regimes. Such approach\nhandles structural changes in asset prices. In this light, we draw implications\nfor portfolio optimization, when investors diversify their stock portfolios\nwith natural gas and crude oil assets. We minimize the portfolio's variance,\nsemi-variance and tail risk, in the presence and the absence of constraints on\nthe portfolio's expected return and/or U.S. stock investment. The return\nconstraint reduces the performance of the optimal portfolio. Moreover, the\nregime-specific portfolio optimization helps implement an enhanced active\nmanagement strategy over the whole sample period. Under a return constraint,\nthe semi-variance optimal portfolio offers the best risk-return tradeoff,\nwhereas the tail-risk optimal portfolio offers the best tradeoff in the absence\nof a return constraint.",

        "abstract": "We examine the Foreign Exchange (FX) spot price spreads with and without Last\nLook on the transaction. We assume that brokers are risk-neutral and they quote\nspreads so that losses to latency arbitrageurs (LAs) are recovered from other\ntraders in the FX market. These losses are reduced if the broker can reject,\nex-post, loss-making trades by enforcing the Last Look option which is a\nfeature of some trading venues in FX markets. For a given rejection threshold\nthe risk-neutral broker quotes a spread to the market so that her expected\nprofits are zero. When there is only one venue, we find that the Last Look\noption reduces quoted spreads. If there are two venues we show that the market\nreaches an equilibrium where traders have no incentive to migrate. The\nequilibrium can be reached with both venues coexisting, or with only one venue\nsurviving. Moreover, when one venue enforces Last Look and the other one does\nnot, counterintuitively, it may be the case that the Last Look venue quotes\nlarger spreads.",

        "abstract": "The global financial crisis, beginning in 2008, took an historic toll on\nnational economies around the world. Following equity market crashes,\nunemployment rates rose significantly in many countries: Italy was among those.\nWhat will be the impact of such large shocks on Italian healthcare finances? An\nempirical model for estimating the impact of the crisis on Italian public\nhealthcare expenditure is presented. Based on data from epidemiological studies\nrelated to past economic crisis, the financial impact is estimated to be\ncomparable to the healthcare deficit of Italian Regions (EUR 3-5 bn). According\nto current agreements between the Italian State and its Regions, public funding\nof regional National Health Services (NHSs) is limited to the amount of\nregional deficit and is subject to previous assessment of strict adherence to\nconstraint on regional healthcare balance-sheet. Those Regions that will fail\nto comply to balance-sheet constraints will suffer cuts on their public NHS\nfinancing with foreseeable bad consequences for the health of their regional\npopulation. The current crisis could be a good timing for a large-scale\nre-engineering of the Italian NHS, probably the only way for\nself-sustainability of the public system.",

The constantly\nevolving nature of cyber-threats and lack of public data sharing mean that the\neconomic conditions required for quoted cyber-insurance premiums to be\nconsidered efficient are highly unlikely to be met. This paper develops Monte\nCarlo simulations of an artificial cyber-insurance market and compares the\nefficient and inefficient outcomes based on the informational setup between the\nmarket participants. The existence of diverse loss distributions is justified\nby the dynamic nature of cyber-threats and the absence of any reliable and\ncentralised incident reporting. It is shown that the limited involvement of\nreinsurers when loss expectations are not shared leads to increased premiums\nand lower overall capacity. This suggests that the sustainability of the\ncyber-insurance market requires both better data sharing and external sources\nof risk tolerant capital.",

While several pandemic intervention policies (PIPs) for\ntackling this pandemic are commercially available, they seem to provide only\npartial epidemiological relief for farmers. In this work, we develop a\nhigh-resolution economical-epidemiological model that captures the pandemic's\nspread in coffee tree farms and its associated economic impact. Through\nextensive simulations for the case of Colombia, a country that consists mostly\nof small-size coffee farms and is the second-largest coffee producer in the\nworld, our results show that it is economically impractical to sustain any\nprofit without directly tackling the pandemic. Furthermore, even in the\nhypothetical case where farmers perfectly know their farm's epidemiological\nstate and the weather in advance, any pandemic-related efforts can only amount\nto a limited profit of roughly 4% on investment. In the more realistic case,\nany pandemic-related efforts are expected to result in economic losses,\nindicating that major disturbances in the coffee market are anticipated.",

This formalism has been at the\nbasis of an enormous success in describing, among others, the particular\nstationary state corresponding to thermal equilibrium. There are, however, vast\nclasses of complex systems which accomodate quite badly, or even not at all,\nwithin the BG formalism. Such dynamical systems exhibit, in one way or another,\nnonergodic aspects. In order to be able to theoretically study at least some of\nthese systems, a formalism was proposed 14 years ago, which is sometimes\nreferred to as nonextensive statistical mechanics.

Furthermore, we provide some\nbridging to important economical phenomena, such as option pricing, return and\nvolume distributions observed in the financial markets, and the fascinating and\nubiquitous concept of risk aversion. One may summarize the whole approach by\nsaying that BG statistical mechanics is based on the entropy $S_{BG}=-k \\sum_i\np_i \\ln p_i$, and typically provides {\\it exponential laws} for describing\nstationary states and basic time-dependent phenomena, while nonextensive\nstatistical mechanics is instead based on the entropic form\n$S_q=k(1-\\sum_ip_i^q)/(q-1)$ (with $S_1=S_{BG}$), and typically provides, for\nthe same type of description, (asymptotic) {\\it power laws}.",

        "abstract": "High-speed computerized trading, often called \"high-frequency trading\" (HFT),\nhas increased dramatically in financial markets over the last decade. In the US\nand Europe, it now accounts for nearly one-half of all trades. Although\nevidence suggests that HFT contributes to the efficiency of markets, there are\nconcerns it also adds to market instability, especially during times of stress.\nCurrently, it is unclear how or why HFT produces these outcomes. In this paper,\nI use data from NASDAQ to show that HFT synchronizes prices in financial\nmarkets, making the values of related securities change contemporaneously. With\na model, I demonstrate how price synchronization leads to increased efficiency:\nprices are more accurate and transaction costs are reduced. During times of\nstress, however, localized errors quickly propagate through the financial\nsystem if safeguards are not in place. In addition, there is potential for HFT\nto enforce incorrect relationships between securities, making prices more (or\nless) correlated than economic fundamentals warrant. This research highlights\nan important role that HFT plays in markets and helps answer several puzzling\nquestions that previously seemed difficult to explain: why HFT is so prevalent,\nwhy HFT concentrates in certain securities and largely ignores others, and\nfinally, how HFT can lower transaction costs yet still make profits.",

        "abstract": "Networks have always played a special role for human beings in shaping social\nrelations, forming public opinion, and driving economic equilibria. Nowadays,\nonline networked platforms dominate digital markets and capitalization\nleader-boards, while social networks drive public discussion. Despite the\nimportance of networks in many economic and social domains (economics,\nsociology, anthropology, psychology,...), the knowledge about the laws that\ndominate their dynamics is still scarce and fragmented. Here, we analyse a wide\nset of online networks (those financed by advertising) by investigating their\nvalue dynamics from several perspectives: the type of service, the geographic\nscope, the merging between networks, and the relationship between economic and\nfinancial value. The results show that the networks are dominated by strongly\nnonlinear dynamics. The existence of non-linearity is often underestimated in\nsocial sciences because it involves contexts that are difficult to deal with,\nsuch as the presence of multiple equilibria -- some of which are unstable. Yet,\nthese dynamics must be fully understood and addressed if we aim to understand\nthe recent evolution in the economic, political and social milieus, which are\nprecisely characterised by corner equilibria (e.g., polarization,\nwinner-take-all solutions, increasing inequality) and nonlinear patterns.",

        "Published: ": "2013-10-22T19:58:32Z",
        "abstract": "A certain spectrum, indexed by a\\in[0,\\infty], of upper bounds P_a(X;x) on\nthe tail probability P(X\\geq x), with P_0(X;x)=P(X\\geq x) and P_\\infty(X;x)\nbeing the best possible exponential upper bound on P(X\\geq x), is shown to be\nstable and monotonic in a, x, and X, where x is a real number and X is a random\nvariable. The bounds P_a(X;x) are optimal values in certain minimization\nproblems. The corresponding spectrum, also indexed by a\\in[0,\\infty], of upper\nbounds Q_a(X;p) on the (1-p)-quantile of X is stable and monotonic in a, p, and\nX, with Q_0(X;p) equal the largest (1-p)-quantile of X. In certain sense, the\nquantile bounds Q_a(X;p) are usually close enough to the true quantiles\nQ_0(X;p). Moreover, Q_a(X;p) is subadditive in X if a\\geq 1, as well as\npositive-homogeneous and translation-invariant, and thus is a so-called\ncoherent measure of risk. A number of other useful properties of the bounds\nP_a(X;x) and Q_a(X;p) are established. In particular, quite similarly to the\nbounds P_a(X;x) on the tail probabilities, the quantile bounds Q_a(X;p) are the\noptimal values in certain minimization problems. This allows for a\ncomparatively easy incorporation of the bounds P_a(X;x) and Q_a(X;p) into more\nspecialized optimization problems. It is shown that the minimization problems\nfor which P_a(X;x) and Q_a(X;p) are the optimal values are in a certain sense\ndual to each other; in the case a=\\infty this corresponds to the bilinear\nLegendre--Fenchel duality. In finance, the (1-p)-quantile Q_0(X;p) is known as\nthe value-at-risk (VaR), whereas the value of Q_1(X;p) is known as the\nconditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and also as the expected shortfall (ES),\naverage value-at-risk (AVaR), and expected tail loss (ETL). It is shown that\nthe quantile bounds Q_a(X;p) can be used as measures of economic inequality.\nThe spectrum parameter, a, may be considered an index of sensitivity to\nrisk/inequality.",

        "abstract": "We study analytically and numerically Minsky instability as a combination of\ntop-down, bottom-up and peer-to-peer positive feedback loops. The peer-to-peer\ninteractions are represented by the links of a network formed by the\nconnections between firms, contagion leading to avalanches and percolation\nphase transitions propagating across these links. The global parameter in the\ntop-bottom, bottom-up feedback loop is the interest rate. Before the Minsky\nmoment, in the Minsky Loans Accelerator stage, the relevant bottom parameter\nrepresenting the individual firms micro-states is the quantity of loans. After\nthe Minsky moment, in the Minsky Crisis Accelerator stage, the relevant bottom\nparameters are the number of ponzi units / quantity of failures, defaults. We\nrepresent the top-bottom, bottom-up interactions on a plot similar to the\nMarshal-Walras diagram for quantity-price market equilibrium (where the\ninterest rate is the analog of the price). The Minsky instability is then\nsimply emerging as a consequence of the fixed point (the intersection of the\nsupply and demand curves) being unstable (repulsive). In the presence of\nnetwork effects, one obtains more than one fixed point and a few dynamic\nregimes (phases).

Two constrained dynamic economic problems\nare presented using the economic terminology in an intuitive way. First, the\nPhillips model of business cycle is presented as a system of forced\noscillations and the general problem of two interacting economies is solved by\nthe nonholonomic dynamics approach. Second, the Cass-Koopmans-Ramsey model of\neconomical growth is solved as a variational problem with a velocity dependent\nconstraint using the vakonomic approach. The specifics of the solution\ninterpretation in economics compared to mechanics is discussed in detail, a\ndiscussion of the nonholonomic and vakonomic approaches to constrained problems\nin mechanics and economics is provided and an economic interpretation of the\nLagrange multipliers (possibly surprising for the students of physics) is\ncarefully explained. The paper can be used by the undergraduate students of\nphysics interested in interdisciplinary physics applications to get in touch\nwith current scientific approach to economics based on a physical background or\nby university teachers as an attractive supplement to the classical mechanics\nlessons.",

While at the same time\nbeing popular among natural science researchers for its proximity to the\nsuccessful methods of physics and chemistry for example, the field of ACE has\nalso received critics by a part of the social science community for its lack of\nempiricism. Yet recent trends have shifted the weights of these general\narguments and potentially given ACE a whole new range of realism. At the base\nof these trends are found two present-day major scientific breakthroughs: the\nsteady shift of psychology towards a hard science due to the advances of\nneuropsychology, and the progress of artificial intelligence and more\nspecifically machine learning due to increasing computational power and big\ndata. These two have also found common fields of study in the form of\ncomputational neuroscience, and human-computer interaction, among others. We\noutline here the main lines of a computational research study of collective\neconomic behavior via Agent-Based Models (ABM) or Multi-Agent System (MAS),\nwhere each agent would be endowed with specific cognitive and behavioral biases\nknown to the field of neuroeconomics, and at the same time autonomously\nimplement rational quantitative financial strategies updated by machine\nlearning.

        "abstract": "Travel time derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value\nfrom road travel times, serving as an underlying asset that cannot be directly\ntraded. Within the transportation domain, these derivatives are proposed as a\nmore comprehensive approach to value pricing. They enable road pricing based\nnot only on the level of travel time but also its volatility. In the financial\nmarket, travel time derivatives are introduced as innovative hedging\ninstruments to mitigate market risk, particularly in light of recent stress\nexperienced by the crypto market and traditional banking sector.\n  The paper focuses on three main aspects: (1) the motivation behind the\nintroduction of these derivatives, driven by the demand for hedging; (2)\nexploring the potential market for these instruments; and (3) delving into the\nproduct design and pricing schemes associated with them. The pricing schemes\nare devised by utilizing real-time travel time data captured by sensors. These\ndata are modeled using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and, more broadly,\ncontinuous time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) models. The calibration\nof these models is achieved through a hidden factor model, which describes the\ndynamics of travel time processes. The risk-neutral pricing principle is then\nemployed to determine the prices of the derivatives, employing well-designed\nprocedures to identify the market value of risk.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an empirical test of financial contagion in European\nequity markets during the tumultuous period of 2008-2011. Our analysis shows\nthat traditional GARCH and Gaussian stochastic-volatility models are unable to\nexplain two key stylized features of global markets during presumptive\ncontagion periods: shocks to aggregate market volatility can be sudden and\nexplosive, and they are associated with specific directional biases in the\ncross-section of country-level returns. Our model repairs this deficit by\nassuming that the random shocks to volatility are heavy-tailed and correlated\ncross-sectionally, both with each other and with returns. The fundamental\nconclusion of our analysis is that great care is needed in modeling volatility\nif one wishes to characterize the relationship between volatility and contagion\nthat is predicted by economic theory.\n  In analyzing daily data, we find evidence for significant contagion effects\nduring the major EU crisis periods of May 2010 and August 2011, where contagion\nis defined as excess correlation in the residuals from a factor model\nincorporating global and regional market risk factors. Some of this excess\ncorrelation can be explained by quantifying the impact of shocks to aggregate\nvolatility in the cross-section of expected returns - but only, it turns out,\nif one is extremely careful in accounting for the explosive nature of these\nshocks. We show that global markets have time-varying cross-sectional\nsensitivities to these shocks, and that high sensitivities strongly predict\nperiods of financial crisis. Moreover, the pattern of temporal changes in\ncorrelation structure between volatility and returns is readily interpretable\nin terms of the major events of the periods in question.",

The rise of predictive maintenance is possible due to the\ngrowing trend of industry 4.0 and the availability of inexpensive sensors.\nHowever, the adoption rate for predictive maintenance by companies remains low.\nThe majority of companies are sticking to corrective and preventive\nmaintenance. This is not due to a lack of information on the technical\nimplementation of predictive maintenance, with an abundance of research papers\non state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms that can be used effectively.\nThe main issue is that most upper management has not yet been fully convinced\nof the idea of predictive maintenance. The economic value of the implementation\nhas to be linked to the predictive maintenance program for better justification\nby the management. In this study, three machine learning models were trained to\ndemonstrate the economic value of predictive maintenance. Data was collected\nfrom a testbed located at the Singapore University of Technology and Design.\nThe testbed closely resembles a real-world water treatment plant. A\ncost-benefit analysis coupled with Monte Carlo simulation was proposed. It\nprovided a structured approach to document potential costs and savings by\nimplementing a predictive maintenance program. The simulation incorporated\nreal-world risk into a financial model. Financial figures were adapted from\nCITIC Envirotech Ltd, a leading membrane-based integrated environmental\nsolutions provider. Two scenarios were used to elaborate on the economic values\nof predictive maintenance.

Using these dimensions,\ndebtors could be classified into 16 different typologies. We identified 5 main\ntypologies, which account for 63% of the debtors in our data set. Further, we\nobserved that each debtor typology reacted differently to the content and\ntiming of reminder messages, allowing us to define an optimal debt collection\nstrategy for each typology. For example, sending a reciprocity message at 8\np.m. in the evening is the most successful strategy to get a reaction from a\ndebtor who is willing to pay their debt, able to pay their debt, chaotic in\nterms of their financial organization, and emotional when communicating and\nhandling their finances.

Recently,\nTensor Decomposition (TD) techniques have shown promising results in reducing\nthe computational costs associated with large-dimensional financial models\nwhile achieving comparable performance. However, tensor models are often unable\nto incorporate the underlying economic domain knowledge. To this end, we\ndevelop a novel Graph-Regularized Tensor Regression (GRTR) framework, whereby\nknowledge about cross-asset relations is incorporated into the model in the\nform of a graph Laplacian matrix. This is then used as a regularization tool to\npromote an economically meaningful structure within the model parameters. By\nvirtue of tensor algebra, the proposed framework is shown to be fully\ninterpretable, both coefficient-wise and dimension-wise. The GRTR model is\nvalidated in a multi-way financial forecasting setting and compared against\ncompeting models, and is shown to achieve improved performance at reduced\ncomputational costs. Detailed visualizations are provided to help the reader\ngain an intuitive understanding of the employed tensor operations.",

        "abstract": "Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are an effective way to formally describe\nmany Machine Learning problems. In fact, recently MDPs have also emerged as a\npowerful framework to model financial trading tasks. For example, financial\nMDPs can model different market scenarios. However, the learning of a\n(near-)optimal policy for each of these financial MDPs can be a very\ntime-consuming process, especially when nothing is known about the policy to\nbegin with. An alternative approach is to find a similar financial MDP for\nwhich we have already learned its policy, and then reuse such policy in the\nlearning of a new policy for a new financial MDP. Such a knowledge transfer\nbetween market scenarios raises several issues. On the one hand, how to measure\nthe similarity between financial MDPs. On the other hand, how to use this\nsimilarity measurement to effectively transfer the knowledge between financial\nMDPs. This paper addresses both of these issues. Regarding the first one, this\npaper analyzes the use of three similarity metrics based on conceptual,\nstructural and performance aspects of the financial MDPs. Regarding the second\none, this paper uses Probabilistic Policy Reuse to balance the\nexploitation/exploration in the learning of a new financial MDP according to\nthe similarity of the previous financial MDPs whose knowledge is reused.",

Despite the\nabundance of literature on the subject, this is a notorious challenge in terms\nof implementation. Reasons span from the youth of the field itself to broader\ndata integration concerns that arise from gathering information from financial,\nhuman resource and business excellence systems. This paper aims at setting the\nfirst stones to a simple yet robust quantitative framework for Strategic\nWorkforce Planning exercises. First a method based on structured equations is\ndetailed. It is then used to answer two main workforce related questions: how\nto optimally hire to keep labor costs flat? How to build an experience\nconstrained workforce at a minimal cost?",

Losses due to changes in the weight of the payload to\nbe transported or fuel/time losses due to capricious changes by the driver on\nthe scheduled route. This work aims to demonstrate use of Internet of Thing\n(IoT) techniques to propose a prototype of a telemetry system to monitor in\nreal-time the payload weight and location of a cargo truck and become a\ntechnological tool that supports the tasks of monitoring and control of the use\nof cargo trucks, and together with other logistics measures, leads to\nminimizing economic losses. The development of this project was based on the\nIoT architecture reference model: an ATmega32u4 microcontroller was used\ntogether with a SIM808 GSM and GPS module as the main component of the IoT\nNode. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools were used as an IoT web\nplatform and cloud data storage. The main result was a prototype of a telemetry\nsystem to track a cargo truck via the web; the weight and position data are\naccessible from any device with internet access through a website.

We show that the Gulf crisis had\nthe most adverse impact on Qatar together with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\nAlthough not to the same degree as these three countries, Bahrain and Egypt\nwere also harmfully affected.

The empirical\napplication provides evidence of significant volatility and tail risk\nspillovers from the financial sector to many real economy sectors in the U.S.\neconomy in the period from 2001 to 2011. These spillovers increase in crisis\nperiods. The conditional coexceedance in a given sector is positively related\nto its amount of debt financing, and negatively related to its relative\nvaluation and investment. Real economy sectors which require substantial\nexternal financing, and whose value and investment activity are relatively\nlower, are prime candidates for depreciation in the wake of crisis in the\nfinancial sector.",

        "abstract": "Modern investigation in economics and in other sciences requires the ability\nto store, share, and replicate results and methods of experiments that are\noften multidisciplinary and yield a massive amount of data. Given the\nincreasing complexity and growing interaction across diverse bodies of\nknowledge it is becoming imperative to define a platform to properly support\ncollaborative research and track origin, accuracy and use of data. This paper\nstarts by defining a set of methods leveraging scientific principles and\nadvocating the importance of those methods in multidisciplinary, computer\nintensive fields like computational finance. The next part of this paper\ndefines a class of systems called scientific support systems, vis-a-vis usages\nin other research fields such as bioinformatics, physics and engineering. We\noutline a basic set of fundamental concepts, and list our goals and motivation\nfor leveraging such systems to enable large-scale investigation, \"crowd powered\nscience\", in economics. The core of this paper provides an outline of FRACTI in\nfive steps. First we present definitions related to scientific support systems\nintrinsic to finance and describe common characteristics of financial use\ncases. The second step concentrates on what can be exchanged through the\ndefinition of shareable entities called contributions. The third step is the\ndescription of a classification system for building blocks of the conceptual\nframework, called facets. The fourth step introduces the meta-model that will\nenable provenance tracking and representation of data fragments and simulation.\nFinally we describe intended cases of use to highlight main strengths of\nFRACTI: application of the scientific method for investigation in computational\nfinance, large-scale collaboration and simulation.",

        "abstract": "Economic and financial theories and practice essentially deal with uncertain\nfuture. Humans encounter uncertainty in different kinds of activity, from\nsensory-motor control to dynamics in financial markets, what has been subject\nof extensive studies. Representation of uncertainty with normal or lognormal\ndistribution is a common feature of many of those studies. For example,\nproposed Bayessian integration of Gaussian multisensory input in the brain or\nlog-normal distribution of future asset price in renowned Black-Scholes-Merton\n(BSM) model for pricing contingent claims.\n  Standard deviation of log(future asset price) scaled by square root of time\nin the BSM model is called implied volatility. Actually, log(future asset\nprice) is not normally distributed and traders account for that to avoid\nlosses. Nevertheless the BSM formula derived under the assumption of constant\nvolatility remains a major uniform framework for pricing options in financial\nmarkets. I propose that one of the reasons for such a high popularity of the\nBSM formula could be its ability to translate uncertainty measured with implied\nvolatility into price in a way that is compatible with human intuition for\nmeasuring uncertainty.\n  The present study deals with mathematical relationship between uncertainty\nand the BSM implied volatility. Examples for a number of common probability\ndistributions are presented. Overall, this work proposes that representation of\nvarious probability distributions in terms of the BSM implied volatility\nprofile may be meaningful in both biological and financial worlds.

        "abstract": "In this study the cross-correlations between the cryptocurrency market\nrepresented by the two most liquid and highest-capitalized cryptocurrencies:\nbitcoin and ethereum, on the one side, and the instruments representing the\ntraditional financial markets: stock indices, Forex, commodities, on the other\nside, are measured in the period: January 2020--October 2022. Our purpose is to\naddress the question whether the cryptocurrency market still preserves its\nautonomy with respect to the traditional financial markets or it has already\naligned with them in expense of its independence. We are motivated by the fact\nthat some previous related studies gave mixed results. By calculating the\n$q$-dependent detrended cross-correlation coefficient based on the high\nfrequency 10 s data in the rolling window, the dependence on various time\nscales, different fluctuation magnitudes, and different market periods are\nexamined. There is a strong indication that the dynamics of the bitcoin and\nethereum price changes since the March 2020 Covid-19 panic is no longer\nindependent. Instead, it is related to the dynamics of the traditional\nfinancial markets, which is especially evident now in 2022, when the bitcoin\nand ethereum coupling to the US tech stocks is observed during the market bear\nphase. It is also worth emphasizing that the cryptocurrencies have begun to\nreact to the economic data such as the Consumer Price Index readings in a\nsimilar way as traditional instruments. Such a spontaneous coupling of the so\nfar independent degrees of freedom can be interpreted as a kind of phase\ntransition that resembles the collective phenomena typical for the complex\nsystems. Our results indicate that the cryptocurrencies cannot be considered as\na safe haven for the financial investments.",

This has brought awareness of the urgent need for novel approaches\nthat capture systemic riskiness. The purpose of this paper is to specify a\ngeneral methodological framework that is flexible enough to cover a wide range\nof possibilities to design systemic risk measures via multi-dimensional\nacceptance sets and aggregation functions, and to study corresponding examples.\nExisting systemic risk measures can usually be interpreted as the minimal\ncapital needed to secure the system after aggregating individual risks. In\ncontrast, our approach also includes systemic risk measures that can be\ninterpreted as the minimal capital funds that secure the aggregated system by\nallocating capital to the single institutions before aggregating the individual\nrisks. This allows for a possible ranking of the institutions in terms of\nsystemic riskiness measured by the optimal allocations. Moreover, we also allow\nfor the possibility of allocating the funds according to the future state of\nthe system (random allocation). We provide conditions which ensure\nmonotonicity, convexity, or quasi-convexity properties of our systemic risk\nmeasures.",

        "abstract": "In both finance and economics, quantitative models are usually studied as\nisolated mathematical objects --- most often defined by very strong simplifying\nassumptions concerning rationality, efficiency and the existence of\ndisequilibrium adjustment mechanisms. This raises the important question of how\nsensitive such models might be to real-world effects that violate the\nassumptions. We show how the consequences of rational behavior caused by\nperverse incentives, as well as various irrational tendencies identified by\nbehavioral economists, can be systematically and consistently introduced into\nan agent-based model for a financial asset. This generates a class of models\nwhich, in the special case where such effects are absent, reduces to geometric\nBrownian motion --- the usual equilibrium pricing model. Thus we are able to\nnumerically perturb a widely-used equilibrium pricing model market and\ninvestigate its stability. The magnitude of such perturbations in real markets\ncan be estimated and the simulations imply that this is far outside the\nstability region of the equilibrium solution, which is no longer observed.\nIndeed the price fluctuations generated by endogenous dynamics, are in good\ngeneral agreement with the excess kurtosis and heteroskedasticity of actual\nasset prices. The methodology is presented within the context of a financial\nmarket. However, there are close links to concepts and theories from both\nmicro- and macro-economics including rational expectations, Soros' theory of\nreflexivity, and Minsky's theory of financial instability.",

The\nduration of ${\\Delta}$ determines Taylor series of investor's utility over\ncurrent and future values of consumption. We present consumption at current and\nfuture moments as sums of their mean values and perturbations during ${\\Delta}$\nof the price at current moment t and perturbations of the payoff at day t+1.\nFor linear and quadratic Taylor series approximations of the basic equation we\nobtain new relations on mean price, mean payoff, their volatilities, skewness\nand amount of asset ${\\xi}_{max}$ that delivers max to investor's utility. The\nstochasticity of market trade time-series defines random properties of the\nasset price time-series during ${\\Delta}$. We introduce new market-based price\nprobability measure entirely determined by frequency-based probability measures\nof the market trade value and volume. The conventional frequency-based price\nprobability is a very special case of the market-based price probability\nmeasure when all trade volumes during ${\\Delta}$ equal unit. Prediction of the\nmarket-based price probability at horizon T equals forecast of the market trade\nvalue and volume probabilities at same horizon.

        "Published: ": "2022-01-31T16:22:41Z",
        "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic drastically emphasized the fragility of national and\ninternational supply networks (SNs),leading to significant supply shortages of\nessential goods for people, such as food and medical equipment. Severe\ndisruptions that propagate along complex SNs can expose the population of\nentire regions or even countries to these risks. A lack of both, data and\nquantitative methodology, has hitherto hindered us to empirically quantify the\nvulnerability of the population to disruptions. Here we develop a data-driven\nsimulation methodology to locally quantify actual supply losses for the\npopulation that result from the cascading of supply disruptions. We demonstrate\nthe method on a large food SN of a European country including 22,938 business\npremises, 44,355 supply links and 116 local administrative districts. We rank\nthe business premises with respect to their criticality for the districts'\npopulation with the proposed systemic risk index, SRIcrit, to identify around\n30 premises that -- in case of their failure -- are expected to cause critical\nsupply shortages in sizable fractions of the population. The new methodology is\nimmediately policy relevant as a fact-driven and generalizable crisis\nmanagement tool. This work represents a starting point for quantitatively\nstudying SN disruptions focused on the well-being of the population.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces and formalizes the classical view on supply and demand,\nwhich, we argue, has an integrity independent and distinct from the\nneoclassical theory. Demand and supply, before the marginal revolution, are\ndefined not by an unobservable criterion such as a utility function, but by an\nobservable monetary variable, the reservation price: the buyer's (maximum)\nwillingness to pay (WTP) value (a potential price) and the seller's (minimum)\nwillingness to accept (WTA) value (a potential price) at the marketplace.\nMarket demand and supply are the cumulative distribution of the buyers' and\nsellers' reservation prices, respectively. This WTP-WTA classical view of\nsupply and demand formed the means whereby market participants were motivated\nin experimental economics although experimentalists (trained in neoclassical\neconomics) were not cognizant of their link to the past. On this foundation was\nerected a vast literature on the rules of trading for a host of institutions,\nmodern and ancient. This paper documents textually this reappraisal of\nclassical economics and then formalizes it mathematically. A follow-up paper\nwill articulate a theory of market price formation rooted in this classical\nview on supply and demand and in experimental findings on market behavior.",

        "abstract": "The Global Financial Crisis of 2008, caused by the accumulation of excessive\nfinancial risk, inspired Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin. Now, more than ten\nyears later, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a peer-to-peer financial paradigm\nwhich leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure its integrity and\nsecurity, contains over 702m USD of capital as of April 15th, 2020. As this\necosystem develops, it is at risk of the very sort of financial meltdown it is\nsupposed to be preventing. In this paper we explore how design weaknesses and\nprice fluctuations in DeFi protocols could lead to a DeFi crisis. We focus on\nDeFi lending protocols as they currently constitute most of the DeFi ecosystem\nwith a 76% market share by capital as of April 15th, 2020.\n  First, we demonstrate the feasibility of attacking Maker's governance design\nto take full control of the protocol, the largest DeFi protocol by market\nshare, which would have allowed the theft of 0.5bn USD of collateral and the\nminting of an unlimited supply of DAI tokens. In doing so, we present a novel\nstrategy utilizing so-called flash loans that would have in principle allowed\nthe execution of the governance attack in just two transactions and without the\nneed to lock any assets. Approximately two weeks after we disclosed the attack\ndetails, Maker modified the governance parameters mitigating the attack\nvectors. Second, we turn to a central component of financial risk in DeFi\nlending protocols. Inspired by stress-testing as performed by central banks, we\ndevelop a stress-testing framework for a stylized DeFi lending protocol,\nfocusing our attention on the impact of a drying-up of liquidity on protocol\nsolvency. Based on our parameters, we find that with sufficiently illiquidity a\nlending protocol with a total debt of 400m USD could become undercollateralized\nwithin 19 days.",

The resulting\nmarket-clearing process--implemented via convex programming--yields\ncorresponding schedules and payments based on traditional energy prices for\npower supply and per-cycle prices for storage utilization. We illustrate the\nbenefits of our solution by comparing the competitive equilibrium of the\nresulting mechanism to that of an alternative solution that uses prosumer-based\nbids. Our solution shows several advantages over the prosumer-based approach.\nIt does not require a priori price estimation.

Due to its wide and significant application, enterprise\nfinancial risk analysis has always been the core research topic in the fields\nof Finance and Management. Based on advanced computer science and artificial\nintelligence technologies, enterprise risk analysis research is experiencing\nrapid developments and making significant progress. Therefore, it is both\nnecessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies.\nAlthough there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on enterprise\nrisk analysis from the perspective of Finance and Management, these surveys\nintroduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack recent advances in\nenterprise financial risk analysis. In contrast, this paper attempts to provide\na systematic literature survey of enterprise risk analysis approaches from Big\nData perspective, which reviews more than 250 representative articles in the\npast almost 50 years (from 1968 to 2023). To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first and only survey work on enterprise financial risk from Big Data\nperspective. Specifically, this survey connects and systematizes the existing\nenterprise financial risk studies, i.e. to summarize and interpret the\nproblems, methods, and spotlights in a comprehensive way. In particular, we\nfirst introduce the issues of enterprise financial risks in terms of their\ntypes,granularity, intelligence, and evaluation metrics, and summarize the\ncorresponding representative works. Then, we compare the analysis methods used\nto learn enterprise financial risk, and finally summarize the spotlights of the\nmost representative works. Our goal is to clarify current cutting-edge research\nand its possible future directions to model enterprise risk, aiming to fully\nunderstand the mechanisms of enterprise risk generation and contagion.",

We develop a generic method to estimate\nthe Kolmogorov complexity of numeric series. This approach is based on an\niterative \"regularity erasing procedure\" implemented to use lossless\ncompression algorithms on financial data. Examples are provided with both\nsimulated and real-world financial time series. The contributions of this\narticle are twofold. The first one is methodological : we show that some\nstructural regularities, invisible with classical statistical tests, can be\ndetected by this algorithmic method. The second one consists in illustrations\non the daily Dow-Jones Index suggesting that beyond several well-known\nregularities, hidden structure may in this index remain to be identified.",

        "abstract": "Why do household saving rates differ so much across countries? This\nmicro-level question has global implications: countries that systematically\n\"oversave\" export capital by running current account surpluses. In the\nrecipient countries, interest rates are thus too low and financial stability is\nput at risk. Existing theories argue that saving is precautionary, but tests\nare limited to cross-country comparisons and are not always supportive. We\nreport the findings of an original survey experiment. Using a simulated\nfinancial saving task implemented online, we compare the saving preferences of\na large and diverse sample of Chinese-Canadians with other Canadians. This\ncomparison is instructive given that Chinese-Canadians migrated from, or\ndescend from those who migrated from, a high-saving environment to a\nlow-savings, high-debt environment. We also compare behavior in the presence\nand absence of a simulated \"welfare state,\" which we represent in the form of\nmandatory insurance. Our respondents exhibit behavior in the saving task that\ncorresponds to standard economic assumptions about lifecycle savings and risk\naversion. We find strong evidence that precautionary saving is reduced when a\nmandatory insurance is present, but no sign that Chinese cultural influences -\nrepresented in linguistic or ethnic terms - have any effect on saving behavior.",

        "abstract": "The decreasing cost of energy storage technologies coupled with their\npotential to bring significant benefits to electric power networks have kindled\nresearch efforts to design both market and regulatory frameworks to facilitate\nthe efficient construction and operation of such technologies. In this paper,\nwe examine an open access approach to the integration of storage, which enables\nthe complete decoupling of a storage facility's ownership structure from its\noperation. In particular, we analyze a nodal spot pricing system built on a\nmodel of economic dispatch in which storage is centrally dispatched by the\nindependent system operator (ISO) to maximize social welfare. Concomitant with\nsuch an approach is the ISO's collection of a merchandising surplus reflecting\ncongestion in storage. We introduce a class of tradable electricity derivatives\n---referred to as financial storage rights (FSRs)--- to enable the\nredistribution of such rents in the form of financial property rights to\nstorage capacity; and establish a generalized simultaneous feasibility test to\nensure the ISO's revenue adequacy when allocating such financial property\nrights to market participants. Several advantages of such an approach to open\naccess storage are discussed.

The use of AI\nin the financial sector further raises critical questions about data privacy\nand security. A further issue identified in this report is the systemic risk\nthat AI can introduce to the financial sector. Being prone to errors, AI can\nexacerbate existing systemic risks, potentially leading to financial crises.\nRegulation is crucial to harnessing the benefits of AI while mitigating its\npotential risks. Despite the global recognition of this need, there remains a\nlack of clear guidelines or legislation for AI use in finance. This report\ndiscusses key principles that could guide the formation of effective AI\nregulation in the financial sector, including the need for a risk-based\napproach, the inclusion of ethical considerations, and the importance of\nmaintaining a balance between innovation and consumer protection. The report\nprovides recommendations for academia, the finance industry, and regulators.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we present models where participants strategically select\ntheir risk levels and earn corresponding rewards, mirroring real-world\ncompetition across various sectors. Our analysis starts with a normal form game\ninvolving two players in a continuous action space, confirming the existence\nand uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium and providing an analytical solution. We\nthen extend this analysis to multi-player scenarios, introducing a new\nnumerical algorithm for its calculation. A key novelty of our work lies in\nusing regret minimization algorithms to solve continuous games through\ndiscretization. This groundbreaking approach enables us to incorporate\nadditional real-world factors like market frictions and risk correlations among\nfirms. We also experimentally validate that the Nash equilibrium in our model\nalso serves as a correlated equilibrium. Our findings illuminate how market\nfrictions and risk correlations affect strategic risk-taking. We also explore\nhow policy measures can impact risk-taking and its associated rewards, with our\nmodel providing broader applicability than the Diamond-Dybvig framework. We\nmake our methodology and open-source code available at\nhttps://github.com/louisabraham/cfrgame\n  Finally, we contribute methodologically by advocating the use of algorithms\nin economics, shifting focus from finite games to games with continuous action\nsets. Our study provides a solid framework for analyzing strategic interactions\nin continuous action games, emphasizing the importance of market frictions,\nrisk correlations, and policy measures in strategic risk-taking dynamics.",

        "abstract": "The insufficient understanding of the credit network structure was recognized\nas a key factor for regulators' underestimation of the destructive systematic\nrisk during the financial crisis that started in 2007. The existing credit\nnetwork research either took a macro perspective to clarify the topological\nproperties of financial systems at a descriptive level or analyzed the risk\ntransmission path and characteristics of individual entities with much\npre-assumptions of the network. Here, we used the theory of complex network to\nmodel China's credit system from 2000 to 2014 based on actual financial data. A\nbipartite financial institution-firm network and its projected sub-networks\nwere constructed for an integrated analysis from both macro and micro\nperspectives, and the relationship between typological properties and\nsystematic credit risk control was also explored. The typological analysis of\nthe networks suggested that the financial institutions and firms were highly\nbut asymmetrically connected, and the credit network structure made local\nidiosyncratic shocks possible to proliferate through the whole economy. In\naddition, the Chinese credit market was still dominated by state-owned\nfinancial institutions with firms competing fiercely for financial resources in\nthe past fifteen years. Furthermore, the credit risk score (CRS) was introduced\nby simulation to identify the systematically important vertices in terms of\nsystematic risk control. The results indicated that the vertices with more\naccess to the credit market or less likelihood to be a bridge in the network\nwere the ones with higher systematically importance. The empirical results from\nthis study would provide specific policy suggestions to financial regulators on\nsupervisory approaches and optimizing the allocation of regulatory resources to\nenhance the robustness of credit systems in China and in other countries.",

        "abstract": "Proof of Stake (PoS) is a burgeoning Sybil resistance mechanism that aims to\nhave a digital asset (\"token\") serve as security collateral in crypto networks.\nHowever, PoS has so far eluded a comprehensive threat model that encompasses\nboth Byzantine attacks from distributed systems and financial attacks that\narise from the dual usage of the token as a means of payment and a Sybil\nresistance mechanism. In particular, the existence of derivatives markets makes\nmalicious coordination among validators easier to execute than in Proof of Work\nsystems. We demonstrate that it is also possible for on-chain lending smart\ncontracts to cannibalize network security in PoS systems. When the yield\nprovided by these contracts is more attractive than the inflation rate provided\nfrom staking, stakers will tend to remove their staked tokens and lend them\nout, thus reducing network security. In this paper, we provide a simple\nstochastic model that describes how rational validators with varying risk\npreferences react to changes in staking and lending returns. For a particular\nconfiguration of this model, we provide a formal proof of a phase transition\nbetween equilibria in which tokens are predominantly staked and those in which\nthey are predominantly lent. We further validate this emergent adversarial\nbehavior (e.g. reduced staked token supply) with agent-based simulations that\nsample transitions under more realistic conditions. Our results illustrate that\nrational, non-adversarial actors can dramatically reduce PoS network security\nif block rewards are not calibrated appropriately above the expected yields of\non-chain lending.",

The empirical work reveals that market crowd trade a stock in\nefficient adaptation except for simple heuristics, gradually tend to achieve\nagreement on an outcome or an asset price widely on a trading day, and generate\nsuch a stationary equilibrium price very often in interaction and competition\namong themselves no matter whether it is highly overestimated or\nunderestimated. This suggests that asset prices include not only a fundamental\nvalue but also private information, speculative, sentiment, attention, gamble,\nand entertainment values etc. Moreover, market crowd adapt to gain and loss by\ntrading volume increase or decrease significantly in interaction with\nenvironment in any two consecutive trading days. Our results demonstrate how\ninteraction between information and news, the trading action, and return\noutcomes in the three-term feedback loop produces excessive trading volume\nwhich includes various internal and external causes.",

        "Published: ": "2023-07-26T17:41:51Z",
        "abstract": "Financial contagion has been widely recognized as a fundamental risk to the\nfinancial system. Particularly potent is price-mediated contagion, wherein\nforced liquidations by firms depress asset prices and propagate financial\nstress, enabling crises to proliferate across a broad spectrum of seemingly\nunrelated entities. Price impacts are currently modeled via exogenous inverse\ndemand functions. However, in real-world scenarios, only the initial shocks and\nthe final equilibrium asset prices are typically observable, leaving actual\nasset liquidations largely obscured. This missing data presents significant\nlimitations to calibrating the existing models. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a novel dual neural network structure that operates in two sequential\nstages: the first neural network maps initial shocks to predicted asset\nliquidations, and the second network utilizes these liquidations to derive\nresultant equilibrium prices. This data-driven approach can capture both linear\nand non-linear forms without pre-specifying an analytical structure;\nfurthermore, it functions effectively even in the absence of observable\nliquidation data. Experiments with simulated datasets demonstrate that our\nmodel can accurately predict equilibrium asset prices based solely on initial\nshocks, while revealing a strong alignment between predicted and true\nliquidations. Our explainable framework contributes to the understanding and\nmodeling of price-mediated contagion and provides valuable insights for\nfinancial authorities to construct effective stress tests and regulatory\npolicies.",

Gaussian Mixture Models are able to cluster input data with respect\nto market's conditions and therefore no correlation matrices are needed for\nrisk computation. Sampling from each cluster with respect to their weights and\nthen calculating the volatility-adjusted stock returns leads to possible\nscenarios for prices of assets.

        "abstract": "We quantify the sensitivity of the Eisenberg-Noe clearing vector to\nestimation errors in the bilateral liabilities of a financial system in a\nstylized setting. The interbank liabilities matrix is a crucial input to the\ncomputation of the clearing vector. However, in practice central bankers and\nregulators must often estimate this matrix because complete information on\nbilateral liabilities is rarely available. As a result, the clearing vector may\nsuffer from estimation errors in the liabilities matrix. We quantify the\nclearing vector's sensitivity to such estimation errors and show that its\ndirectional derivatives are, like the clearing vector itself, solutions of\nfixed point equations. We describe estimation errors utilizing a basis for the\nspace of matrices representing permissible perturbations and derive analytical\nsolutions to the maximal deviations of the Eisenberg-Noe clearing vector. This\nallows us to compute upper bounds for the worst case perturbations of the\nclearing vector in our simple setting. Moreover, we quantify the probability of\nobserving clearing vector deviations of a certain magnitude, for uniformly or\nnormally distributed errors in the relative liability matrix.\n  Applying our methodology to a dataset of European banks, we find that\nperturbations to the relative liabilities can result in economically sizeable\ndifferences that could lead to an underestimation of the risk of contagion.

        "abstract": "The prosperity of mobile and financial technologies has bred and expanded\nvarious kinds of financial products to a broader scope of people, which\ncontributes to advocating financial inclusion. It has non-trivial social\nbenefits of diminishing financial inequality. However, the technical challenges\nin individual financial risk evaluation caused by the distinct characteristic\ndistribution and limited credit history of new users, as well as the\ninexperience of newly-entered companies in handling complex data and obtaining\naccurate labels, impede further promoting financial inclusion. To tackle these\nchallenges, this paper develops a novel transfer learning algorithm (i.e.,\nTransBoost) that combines the merits of tree-based models and kernel methods.\nThe TransBoost is designed with a parallel tree structure and efficient weights\nupdating mechanism with theoretical guarantee, which enables it to excel in\ntackling real-world data with high dimensional features and sparsity in $O(n)$\ntime complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets and a\nunique large-scale dataset from Tencent Mobile Payment. The results show that\nthe TransBoost outperforms other state-of-the-art benchmark transfer learning\nalgorithms in terms of prediction accuracy with superior efficiency, shows\nstronger robustness to data sparsity, and provides meaningful model\ninterpretation. Besides, given a financial risk level, the TransBoost enables\nfinancial service providers to serve the largest number of users including\nthose who would otherwise be excluded by other algorithms.

According to prospect\ntheory, people are risk-averse with respect to gains and risk-seeking with\nrespect to losses, a phenomenon called \"loss aversion\". Despite of the fact\nthat prospect theory has been well developed in behavioral economics at the\ntheoretical level, there exist very few large-scale empirical studies and most\nof them have been undertaken with micro-panel data. Here we analyze over 28.5\nmillion trades made by 81.3 thousand traders of an online financial trading\ncommunity over 28 months, aiming to explore the large-scale empirical aspect of\nprospect theory. By analyzing and comparing the behavior of winning and losing\ntrades and traders, we find clear evidence of the loss aversion phenomenon, an\nessence in prospect theory. This work hence demonstrates an unprecedented\nlarge-scale empirical evidence of prospect theory, which has immediate\nimplication in financial trading, e.g., developing new trading strategies by\nminimizing the effect of loss aversion. Moreover, we introduce three\nrisk-adjusted metrics inspired by prospect theory to differentiate winning and\nlosing traders based on their historical trading behavior. This offers us\npotential opportunities to augment online social trading, where traders are\nallowed to watch and follow the trading activities of others, by predicting\npotential winners statistically based on their historical trading behavior\nrather than their trading performance at any given point in time.",

Inspired by network theory, we model global trade as a multilayer\nnetwork and study its power structure by investigating the tendency of\neigenvector centrality to concentrate on a small fraction of countries, a\nphenomenon called localization transition. We show that the market underwent a\nsignificant structural variation in 2007 just before the global financial\ncrisis. That year witnessed an abrupt repositioning of countries in the global\nvalue chains, and in particular a remarkable reversal of leading role between\nthe two major economies, the US and China. We uncover the hierarchical\nstructure of the multilayer network based on countries' time series of\neigenvector centralities, and show that trade tends to concentrate between\ncountries with different power dynamics, yet in geographical proximity. We\nfurther investigate the contribution of individual industries to countries'\neconomic dominance, and show that also within industry variations in countries'\nmarket positioning took place in 2007. Moreover, we shed light on the crucial\nrole that domestic trade played in the geopolitical landscape leading China to\novertake the US and cement its status as leading economy of the global value\nchains.

On this basis, we focus on the outbreak of\nCOVID-19 as a case study of an exogenous risk and analyze its impact on the\nStandard and Poor's 500 (S\\&P500) index. We assumed that the S\\&P500 index\nreaches a minimum before rising again in the not-too-distant future. Here we\npresent two cases to forecast the S\\&P500 index.

The forecast is a projection of\na prediction with stochastic fluctuations described by $q$-gaussian diffusion\nprocess with three spatio-temporal regimes.

However,\nthe hypotheses themselves are sometimes criticized. Market impacts, where\ntrades of investors can impact and change market prices, making optimization\nimpossible. In this study, we built an artificial market model by adding\ntechnical analysis strategy agents searching one optimized parameter to a whole\nsimulation run to the prior model and investigated whether investors' inability\nto accurately estimate market impacts in their optimizations leads to\noptimization instability. In our results, the parameter of investment strategy\nnever converged to a specific value but continued to change. This means that\neven if all other traders are fixed, only one investor will use backtesting to\noptimize his/her strategy, which leads to the time evolution of market prices\nbecoming unstable. Optimization instability is one level higher than\n\"non-equilibrium of market prices.\" Therefore, the time evolution of market\nprices produced by investment strategies having such unstable parameters is\nhighly unlikely to be predicted and have stable laws written by equations. This\nnature makes us suspect that financial markets include the principle of natural\nuniformity and indicates the difficulty of building an equation model\nexplaining the time evolution of prices.",

        "abstract": "Each individual investor is different, with different financial goals,\ndifferent levels of risk tolerance and different personal preferences. From the\npoint of view of investment management, these characteristics are often defined\nas objectives and constraints.

It's really a\nbalancing act between risk and return with each investor having unique\nrequirements, as well as a unique financial outlook - essentially a constrained\nutility maximization objective. To analyze how well a customer fits into a\nparticular investor class, one investment house has even designed a structured\nquestionnaire with about two-dozen questions that each has to be answered with\nvalues from 1 to 5. The questions range from personal background (age, marital\nstate, number of children, job type, education type, etc.) to what the customer\nexpects from an investment (capital protection, tax shelter, liquid assets,\netc.).

        "abstract": "We employed the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) methodology to\nsystematically investigate the 2020 stock market crash in the U.S. equities\nsectors with different levels of total market capitalizations through four\nmajor U.S. stock market indexes, including the Wilshire 5000 Total Market\nindex, the S&P 500 index, the S&P MidCap 400 index, and the Russell 2000 index,\nrepresenting the stocks overall, the large capitalization stocks, the middle\ncapitalization stocks and the small capitalization stocks, respectively. During\nthe 2020 U.S. stock market crash, all four indexes lost more than a third of\ntheir values within five weeks, while both the middle capitalization stocks and\nthe small capitalization stocks have suffered much greater losses than the\nlarge capitalization stocks and stocks overall. Our results indicate that the\nprice trajectories of these four stock market indexes prior to the 2020 stock\nmarket crash have clearly featured the obvious LPPLS bubble pattern and were\nindeed in a positive bubble regime. Contrary to the popular belief that the\nCOVID-19 led to the 2020 stock market crash, the 2020 U.S. stock market crash\nwas endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic instability of the\nstock market itself. We also performed the complementary post-mortem analysis\nof the 2020 U.S. stock market crash. Our analyses indicate that the 2020 U.S.\nstock market crash originated from a bubble which began to form as early as\nSeptember 2018; and the bubbles in stocks with different levels of total market\ncapitalizations have significantly different starting time profiles. This study\nnot only sheds new light on the making of the 2020 U.S. stock market crash but\nalso creates a novel pipeline for future real-time crash detection and\nmechanism dissection of any financial market and/or economic index.",

        "abstract": "With the growing use of machine learning (ML) models in critical domains such\nas finance and healthcare, the need to offer recourse for those adversely\naffected by the decisions of ML models has become more important; individuals\nought to be provided with recommendations on actions to take for improving\ntheir situation and thus receiving a favorable decision. Prior work on\nsequential algorithmic recourse -- which recommends a series of changes --\nfocuses on action feasibility and uses the proximity of feature changes to\ndetermine action costs. However, the uncertainties of feature changes and the\nrisk of higher than average costs in recourse have not been considered. It is\nundesirable if a recourse could (with some probability) result in a worse\nsituation from which recovery requires an extremely high cost. It is essential\nto incorporate risks when computing and evaluating recourse. We call the\nrecourse computed with such risk considerations as Safer Algorithmic Recourse\n(SafeAR). The objective is to empower people to choose a recourse based on\ntheir risk tolerance. In this work, we discuss and show how existing recourse\ndesiderata can fail to capture the risk of higher costs. We present a method to\ncompute recourse policies that consider variability in cost and connect\nalgorithmic recourse literature with risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. We\nalso adopt measures \"Value at Risk\" and \"Conditional Value at Risk\" from the\nfinancial literature to summarize risk concisely. We apply our method to two\nreal-world datasets and compare policies with different risk-aversion levels\nusing risk measures and recourse desiderata (sparsity and proximity).",

        "abstract": "Understanding the mutual relationships between information flows and social\nactivity in society today is one of the cornerstones of the social sciences. In\nfinancial economics, the key issue in this regard is understanding and\nquantifying how news of all possible types (geopolitical, environmental,\nsocial, financial, economic, etc.) affect trading and the pricing of firms in\norganized stock markets. In this article, we seek to address this issue by\nperforming an analysis of more than 24 million news records provided by\nThompson Reuters and of their relationship with trading activity for 206 major\nstocks in the S&P US stock index. We show that the whole landscape of news that\naffect stock price movements can be automatically summarized via simple\nregularized regressions between trading activity and news information pieces\ndecomposed, with the help of simple topic modeling techniques, into their\n\"thematic\" features. Using these methods, we are able to estimate and quantify\nthe impacts of news on trading. We introduce network-based visualization\ntechniques to represent the whole landscape of news information associated with\na basket of stocks. The examination of the words that are representative of the\ntopic distributions confirms that our method is able to extract the significant\npieces of information influencing the stock market. Our results show that one\nof the most puzzling stylized fact in financial economies, namely that at\ncertain times trading volumes appear to be \"abnormally large,\" can be partially\nexplained by the flow of news. In this sense, our results prove that there is\nno \"excess trading,\" when restricting to times when news are genuinely novel\nand provide relevant financial information.",

This option pricing approach is consistent\nwith global trading strategies by setting the premium as the value such that\nthe residual hedging risk of the long and short positions in the option are\nequal under optimal hedging. The ERP setup of Marzban et al.

The reinforcement learning procedure developed in Carbonneau and\nGodin (2020), which relies on the deep hedging algorithm of Buehler et al.\n(2019b), is applied to numerically solve the global hedging problems by\nrepresenting trading policies with neural networks. Among other findings,\nnumerical results indicate that in the presence of jump risk, hedging long-term\nputs with shorter-term options entails a significant decrease of both equal\nrisk prices and market incompleteness as compared to trading only the stock.\nMonte Carlo experiments demonstrate the potential of ERP as a fair valuation\napproach providing prices consistent with observable market prices.

        "abstract": "We analyze the relative price change of assets starting from basic\nsupply/demand considerations subject to arbitrary motivations. The resulting\nstochastic differential equation has coefficients that are functions of supply\nand demand. We derive these rigorously. The variance in the relative price\nchange is then also dependent on the supply and demand, and is closely\nconnected to the expected return. An important consequence for risk assessment\nand options pricing is the implication that variance is highest when the\nmagnitude of price change is greatest, and lowest near market extrema. This\noccurs even if supply and demand are not dependent on price trend. The\nstochastic equation differs from the standard equation in mathematical finance\nin which the expected return and variance are decoupled. The methodology has\nimplications for the basic framework for risk assessment, suggesting that\nvolatility should be measured in the context of regimes of price change. The\nmodel we propose shows how investors are often misled by the apparent calm of\nmarkets near a market peak. Risk assessment methods utilizing volatility can be\nimproved using this formulation.",

        "abstract": "We will look at the entire cycle of the investment process relating to all\naspects of, formulating an investment hypothesis, constructing a portfolio\nbased on that, executing the trades to implement it, on-going risk management,\nperiodically measuring the performance of the portfolio, and rebalancing the\nportfolio either due to an increase in the risk parameters or due to a\ndeviation from the intended asset allocation. We provide several illustrative\nanalogies that are meant to intuitively explain the pleasures and the pitfalls\nthat can arise while managing a portfolio. If we consider the entire investment\nmanagement procedure as being akin to connecting the dots of a circle, then the\nCircle of Investment can be represented as a dotted circle with many dots\nfalling approximately on the circumference and with no clue about the exact\nlocation of the centre or the length of the radius. We represent the investment\nprocess as a dotted circle since there is a lot of ambiguity in the various\nsteps involved. The circle also indicates the repetitive nature of many steps\nthat are continuously carried out while investing. This work introduces two new\npoints pertaining to this dotted circle and improves the ability, to understand\nhow far-off this dotted circle is, from a more well-defined circle and, to\ncreate a well-formed circle. The two innovations we introduce are:\n  1. The first, relating to the limitations that apply to any finding in the\nsocial sciences, would be the additional point we introduce that lies near the\ncentre of the circle. We title this as, 'The Uncertainty Principle of the\nSocial Sciences'.\n  2. The second, relating to establishing confidence levels in a systematic\nmanner for each view we associate with a security or group of securities as\nrequired by the Black-Litterman framework, would be the new point we present\nnear the circumference of the circle.",

        "abstract": "Fintech business models based on distributed ledgers -- and their\nsmart-contract variants in particular -- offer the prospect of democratizing\naccess to faster, anywhere-accessible, lower cost, reliable-and-secure\nhigh-quality financial services. In addition to holding great, economically\ntransformative promise, these business models pose new, little-studied risks\nand transaction costs. However, these risks and transaction costs are not\nevident during the demonstration and testing phases of development, when\nadopters and users are drawn from the community of developers themselves, as\nwell as from among non-programmer fintech evangelists. Hence, when the new\nrisks and transaction costs become manifest -- as the fintech business models\nare rolled out across the wider economy -- the consequences may also appear to\nbe new and surprising. The present study represents an effort to get ahead of\nthese developments by delineating risks and transaction costs inherent in\ndistributed-ledger- and smart-contracts-based fintech business models.

        "Published: ": "2023-11-23T22:30:58Z",
        "abstract": "The experience of unknown events such as financial crises and infectious\ndisease crises, which are black swans that appear suddenly, has revealed the\nlimitations of measuring risk under a fixed probability measure. In order to\nsolve this problem, the importance of so-called ambiguity, which allows the\nprobability measure itself to change, has long been recognized in the financial\nworld. On the other hand, there have been many studies on subjective\nprobability measures in the field of economics, including Savage's work. But\neven in those cases, the studies are based on the two levels of uncertainty:\nrisk when a conventional probability measure (probability distribution) is\nknown, and ambiguity due to the fact that the subjective probability measure\ncan be taken arbitrarily in a certain space. In this study, we express n-layer\nuncertainty, which we call hierarchical uncertainty by introducing a new\nconcept called uncertainty spaces which is an extended concept of probability\nspaces. We use uncertainty spaces for providing examples that illustrate\nEllsberg's paradox. Next, we construct an endofunctor S of Mble, the category\nformed by measurable spaces and measurable functions between them, in order to\nembed a given set of uncertainty spaces into it. The endofunctor S maps a\nmeasurable space to a set of capacities defined on the space, where a capacity\nis a non-additive probability measure introduced by Choquet. After developing\nn-layer uncertainty analysis through uncertainty spaces, we construct the\nuniversal uncertainty space as a limit of the sequence of measurable spaces\nrepresenting multi-layer uncertainty. This universal uncertainty space may be\nable to serve as a basis for multi-layer uncertainty theory because it has as\nits projections the uncertainty spaces of all levels. Lastly, we check a\nsufficient condition for making the functor S be a probability monad.",

        "Published: ": "2018-08-10T10:45:58Z",
        "abstract": "Price stability has often been cited as a key reason that cryptocurrencies\nhave not gained widespread adoption as a medium of exchange and continue to\nprove incapable of powering the economy of decentralized applications (DApps)\nefficiently. Exeum proposes a novel method to provide price stable digital\ntokens whose values are pegged to real world assets, serving as a bridge\nbetween the real world and the decentralized economy.\n  Pegged tokens issued by Exeum - for example, USDE refers to a stable token\nissued by the system whose value is pegged to USD - are backed by virtual\nassets in a virtual asset exchange where users can deposit the base token of\nthe system and take long or short positions. Guaranteeing the stability of the\npegged tokens boils down to the problem of maintaining the peg of the virtual\nassets to real world assets, and the main mechanism used by Exeum is\ncontrolling the swap rate of assets. If the swap rate is fully controlled by\nthe system, arbitrageurs can be incentivized enough to restore a broken peg;\nExeum distributes statistical arbitrage trading software to decentralize this\ntype of market making activity. The last major component of the system is a\ncentral bank equivalent that determines the long term interest rate of the base\ntoken, pays interest on the deposit by inflating the supply if necessary, and\nremoves the need for stability fees on pegged tokens, improving their\nusability.\n  To the best of our knowledge, Exeum is the first to propose a truly\ndecentralized method for developing a stablecoin that enables 1:1 value\nconversion between the base token and pegged assets, completely removing the\nmismatch between supply and demand. In this paper, we will also discuss its\napplications, such as improving staking based DApp token models, price stable\ngas fees, pegging to an index of DApp tokens, and performing cross-chain asset\ntransfer of legacy crypto assets.",

In parallel, we propose\nto consider the sentiment around main entities of an article as a more accurate\nproxy for the overall sentiment of such piece of text, and describe a\ncase-study to motivate this choice. Finally, we design features that\ncharacterise the type and structure of news within each week, and map them to\nmoments of financial markets dislocations. The latter are identified as dates\nwith unusually high volatility across asset classes, and we find quantitative\nevidence that they relate to instances of high entropy in the high-dimensional\nspace of interconnected news.

        "abstract": "Economic integration, globalization and financial crises represent examples\nof processes whose understanding requires the analysis of the underlying\nnetwork structure. Of particular interest is establishing whether a real\neconomic network is in a state of (quasi)stationary equilibrium, i.e.\ncharacterized by smooth structural changes rather than abrupt transitions.\nWhile in the former case the behaviour of the system can be reasonably\ncontrolled and predicted, in the latter case this is generally impossible.\nHere, we propose a method to assess whether a real economic network is in a\nquasi-stationary state by checking the consistency of its structural evolution\nwith appropriate quasi-equilibrium maximum-entropy ensembles of graphs. As\nillustrative examples, we consider the International Trade Network (ITN) and\nthe Dutch Interbank Network (DIN). We find that the ITN is an almost perfect\nexample of quasi-equilibrium network, while the DIN is clearly\nout-of-equilibrium. In the latter, the entity of the deviation from\nquasi-stationarity contains precious information that allows us to identify\nremarkable early warning signals of the interbank crisis of 2008. These early\nwarning signals involve certain dyadic and triadic topological properties,\nincluding dangerous 'debt loops' with different levels of interbank\nreciprocity.",

        "abstract": "For centuries, national economies created wealth by engaging in international\ntrade and production. The resulting international supply networks not only\nincrease wealth for countries, but also create systemic risk: economic shocks,\ntriggered by company failures in one country, may propagate to other countries.\nUsing global supply network data on the firm-level, we present a method to\nestimate a country's exposure to direct and indirect economic losses caused by\nthe failure of a company in another country. We show the network of systemic\nrisk-flows across the world. We find that rich countries expose poor countries\nmuch more to systemic risk than the other way round. We demonstrate that higher\nsystemic risk levels are not compensated with a risk premium in GDP, nor do\nthey correlate with economic growth. Systemic risk around the globe appears to\nbe distributed more unequally than wealth. These findings put the often praised\nbenefits for developing countries from globalized production in a new light,\nsince they relate them to the involved risks in the production processes.\nExposure risks present a new dimension of global inequality, that most affects\nthe poor in supply shock crises. It becomes fully quantifiable with the\nproposed method.",

This agent-based viewpoint in finance goes back at least to the work\nof Garman (1976) and shares the philosophy of statistical mechanics in the\nphysical sciences. We discuss recent developments in market microstructure\nmodels. They are capable, often through numerical simulations, to explain many\nstylized facts like the emergence of herding behavior, volatility clustering\nand fat tailed returns distributions. They are typically queueing-type models,\nthat is, models of order flows, in contrast to classical economic equilibrium\ntheories of utility-maximizing, rational, ``representative'' investors.\nMathematically, they are analyzed using tools of functional central limit\ntheorems, strong approximations and weak convergence. Our main examples focus\non investor inertia, a trait that is well-documented, among other behavioral\nqualities, and modelled using semi-Markov switching processes. In particular,\nwe show how inertia may lead to the phenomenon of long-range dependence in\nstock prices.",

The power of the algorithm comes from the fact that it\nuses a small number of parameters with minimal assumptions regarding the data\nbeing examined or the underlying motifs. Our interest lies in applying the\nalgorithm to financial time series data to identify unknown patterns that\nexist. The algorithm is tested using three separate data sets.

In all\ncases the algorithm identifies the presence of a motif population in a fast and\nefficient manner due to the utilisation of an intuitive symbolic\nrepresentation.

        "abstract": "Empirical studies in software engineering are often conducted with\nopen-source developers or in industrial collaborations. Seemingly, this\nresulted in few experiments using financial incentives (e.g., money, vouchers)\nas a strategy to motivate the participants' behavior; which is typically done\nin other research communities, such as economics or psychology. Even the\ncurrent version of the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards does mention payouts for\ncompleting surveys only, but not for mimicking the real-world or motivating\nrealistic behavior during experiments. So, there is a lack of understanding\nregarding whether financial incentives can or cannot be useful for\nsoftware-engineering experimentation. To tackle this problem, we plan a survey\nbased on which we will conduct a controlled laboratory experiment. Precisely,\nwe will use the survey to elicit incentivization schemes we will employ as (up\nto) four payoff functions (i.e., mappings of choices or performance in an\nexperiment to a monetary payment) during a code-review task in the experiment:\n(1) a scheme that employees prefer, (2) a scheme that is actually employed, (3)\na scheme that is performance-independent, and (4) a scheme that mimics an\nopen-source scenario. Using a between-subject design, we aim to explore how the\ndifferent schemes impact the participants' performance.

By contrast, if the heterogeneity of banks'\nconnectivity is controlled for, the same properties show a gradual transition\nto the crisis, starting in 2005 and preceded by an even earlier period during\nwhich anomalous debt loops could have led to the underestimation of\ncounter-party risk.
